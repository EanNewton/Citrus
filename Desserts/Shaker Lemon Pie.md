## Steps

1.  You will need to start this a day before you want to bake it. Wash and dry the lemons, then slice as thinly as you possibly can, preferably with a mandoline, flicking out the seeds as you go. Put the lemon slices in a bowl and cover with the sugar and salt. Stir thoroughly, then cover and leave to macerate for at least 24 hours.
2.  The next day start by making the pastry. Either rub the fats into the spelt flour, or pulse in a food processor until you have a consistency of fine breadcrumbs. Add chilled water sparingly until you can form a smooth dough. Form into a ball then cut into two pieces, one slightly larger than the other. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for an hour.
3.  Preheat the oven to 200 C / 400 F. Roll out the larger round of the pastry on a lightly floured work surface and use it to line a pie dish (between 21 and 23 cm). Next, whisk the eggs and melted butter together, then sprinkle over the 6 tbsp flour and whisk to combine. Pour this over the macerating lemons and mix well. Pour the whole lot into the lined pie dish.
4.  Roll out the remaining pastry and use it to cover the pie, wetting the edges and crimping together. Decorate the pie with any leftover pastry and brush with milk. Cut a couple of slits in the center of the pie.
5.  Bake in the oven for around 30 minutes, then reduce the temperature to 160 C / 325 F and continue to cook for another 20 minutes. Serve hot or cold. I like it hot with a big dollop of clotted cream, but a sweet custard would be just as good.
