## Steps

1.  Put the sugar in a bowl with the rosemary and pour over the just-boiled water. Stir until the sugar dissolved — this gives an instant simple sugar syrup. Leave to infuse until cool.
2.  If freshly squeezed, strain the blood orange and lemon juices into a measuring jug. Add the sugar syrup (including the rosemary) and some more filtered water until you have 500 ml l/ 2 cup liquid.
3.  Put the gelatine leaves in a heatproof bowl, then pour over some of the liquid. Leave to soften for around 10 minutes. Meanwhile, bring a saucepan of water to a boil. Set the bowl containing the gelatine over the pan and stir until it has melted. Pour in the rest of the liquid, then strain through a fine sieve into a clean jug.
4.  Lightly oil a jelly mould or 6 individual moulds or glasses and pour int he strained liquid. When it has completely cooled down, refrigerate until set — it will take at least a couple of hours. To unmould, dip in hot water for a few seconds.
