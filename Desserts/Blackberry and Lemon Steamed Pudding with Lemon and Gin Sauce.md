## Steps

1.  Grease a 1.5 liter / 3 pint pudding basin generously with butter. Put 50 g of the sugar and the cornflour into a bowl and mix to combine and get rid of any lumps. Add the blackberries and toss so they are thoroughly coated. Put these in the base of the buttered pudding basin.
2.  Put the butter, remaining sugar, flour, eggs and lemon zest and juice in a food processor or mixer and blitz until you have a smooth batter. Aim for a dropping consistency and add the milk if necessary.
3.  Pour the batter over the blackberries, making sure the blackberries don't push through round the edges. Fold a pleat into a square of foil and cover the top of the basin, tying it into place with string or fastening with a fat rubber band.
4.  Steam for around 2 hours over a simmering saucepan of water — or in a pressure cooker for 35 minutes, making sure the first 20 minutes isn't at pressure.
5.  To make the sauce, put the zest, sugar and water in a small saucepan. Stir on a low heat until the sugar is completely dissolved, then cover and leave to simmer for 20 minutes — this will give the lemon a chance to infuse and the liquid to become syrupy. Add the lemon juice and gin, then immediately strain into a serving jug.
6.  To serve, remove the lid from the pudding and lightly run a palette knife around the edge. Put a serving plate over the pudding basin and flip over so the pudding drops onto the plate. Serve with the sauce and plenty of cream.
