## Steps

1.  Put the grapefruit zest, mint and sugar into a saucepan with the water. Stir over a gentle heat until the sugar dissolved then turn up the heat and bring to a boil. Remove from the heat immediately, then add the tonic water, gin and grapefruit juice. Leave to cool to room temperature, then chill in the refrigerator.
2.  Strain the liquid into a lidded freezer-proof box. You need it to be fairly wide, so the granita is quite shallow, about 2-3 cm deep. Freeze for an hour, or until a layer of ice has formed around the edge of the granita. Scrape this off with a fork and beat into the rest of the mixture. Repeat with a fork and beat into the rest of the mixture. Repeat this every 30 minutes, until you have a granita formed of ice crystals. Leave in the freezer until you are ready to eat, but if you are leaving it for any length of time, you are going to need to break it up fairly regularly. Serve in small glasses, with a dash of grapefruit bitters, if you like.
