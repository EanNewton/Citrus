## Steps

1.  Put the lemon zest in a food processor with the sugar and salt. Blitz until the zest has all but vanished into the sugar — this will ensure you get a perfectly smooth ice cream.
2.  Add the juice from 2 of the lemons and blitz again, this time to dissolve the sugar. Pour this mixture into the cream and combine thoroughly. Leave to chill in the refrigerator for at least an hour.
3.  To make the praline, line a baking tray with baking parchment. Mix the almonds, fennel seeds and salt together. Put the sugar and water in a small saucepan. Simmer on a low heat, stirring carefully until the sugar has dissolved, then turn up the heat and allow the syrup to bubble until it is a light golden brown — at this point it will be on the verge of turning a deeper color and will be in danger of burning. Remove from the heat immediately and stir in the almond mixture. Tip out onto the lined baking tray and spread it out as much as possible. Leave to cool, by which point it will be hard and brittle. Break into chunks.
4.  Taste the chilled cream mixture and add a little more lemon juice if you think it needs it. Churn in an ice-cream maker until thick, smooth and aerated. Stir around half the praline (save the rest for another occasion) through the ice cream at this point, and churn for a further minute. Scrape into a freezer container and freeze. Remove from the freezer for 10 minutes before you want to serve it.
