## Ingredients

* A small bunch of mint, leaves only

* 250 g melon, prepared weight
* 100 g granulated sugar

## Steps

1.  Put the mint leaves and lime zest in a bowl and muddle them as much as possible to bruise the mint and release oils from the zest. Put the cream or coconut milk in a small saucepan and heat gently until almost boiling. Remove from the heat and add the mint leaves and lime zest. Leave to infuse for as long as you can — at least until the liquid has completely cooled — then strain into a blender. Add the melon, lime juice and sugar and blitz until smooth, then push through a sieve into a clean jug.
2.  Pour into your ice lolly moulds and freeze until solid.
