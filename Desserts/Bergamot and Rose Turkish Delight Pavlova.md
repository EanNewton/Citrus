## Steps

1.  First make the meringue base — this can be made ahead of time and kept for several days in an airtight container, or frozen. Preheat the oven to 160 C / 325 F. Draw a circle the size of a dinner plate on a piece of baking parchment, for guidance, and turn the parchment upside down.
2.  Whisk the egg whites until they have reached the soft peak stage — airy and light, but not yet very stiff and dry. Start adding the sugar, a dessertspoon at a time, whisking vigorously, until all the sugar has been incorporated and the meringue is glossy and keeps its shape. Mix the cornstarch and vinegar together and incorporate this, then fold in the Turkish delight.
3.  Spoon the meringue onto the baking parchment, staying within the marked circle. Make a slight dip in the center if you like and make sure plenty of peaks form by lightly touching the meringue with the back of a spoon and pulling it away.
4.  Put the meringue in the oven and turn the temperature down to 140 C / 275 F. Leave to bake for between 1 and 1 1/2 hours, then turn off the oven and leave in the oven until it has cooled down. The meringue should easily peel away from the paper.
5.  To assemble, whisk the cream with the icing sugar until billowy — make sure it isn't too stiff. Stir through most of the lemon curd, the limoncello or bergamot-cello and the Turkish delight, but go easy — you want a rippled effect, not homogeneity. Top with more lemon curd, Turkish delight and the rose petals.

## Variation
Stir 75 g chopped dark chocolate through the meringue in place of the Turkish delight. Combine the cream with a little orange blossom water, orange curd and a little orange liqueur, then make a quick chocolate sauce with 30 g chocolate and 100 ml / 7 tbsp cream, to pour over the top.
