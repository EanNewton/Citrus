## Steps

1.  Put the tea leaves in a small glass jar or bottle and add the water. Cover and leave in the refrigerator to infuse for 24 hours.
2.  Strain the infused water into a saucepan, add the sugar and heat gently until it has dissolved. Remove from the heat immediately and let it cool to blood temperature (it should feel comfortably warm, not too hot, when you dip your fingers in).
3.  Put the egg yolks in a large, heatproof bowl and, using an electric whisk, whisk until very frothy. Dribble the sugar syrup in a little at a time, whisking gently as you do so, until it is all incorporated. Continue to whisk the mixture until it has increased in volume considerably — at least doubled, preferably more. This will take up to 10 minutes.
4.  Whisk the cream in a separate bowl until it is well aerated but still a soft dropping consistency. Fold it in into the egg and sugar mixture, very gently, preferably in 3-4 stages, being careful not to knock too much air out of it. Pour in the vodka and rose water at the last minute and stir again to incorporate.
5.  Oil a large terrine or loaf tin (or individual moulds if you prefer; I have some owl-shaped ones I love) and line with plastic wrap, then pour in the parfait mixture. Freeze for at least 2-3 hours. When you are close to wanting to serve it, remove from the freezer and transfer to the refrigerator for 15-20 minutes, just to soften slightly. If turning it out whole, dip a knife in hot water to cut it.
