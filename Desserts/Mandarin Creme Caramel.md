## Ingredients

### For the caramel
* 100 g caster sugar

### For the creme

* A pinch of anise seeds (optional)
* 2 eggs, plus 2 egg yolks
* 100 g / 1/2 cup caster sugar

## Steps

1.  Butter 6 fairly shallow ramekins or small ovenproof dishes. Put the milk into a saucepan and add the mandarin zest and anise seeds, if using. Bring almost the a boil, then remove from the heat and leave to infuse.
2.  Next make the caramel. Evenly sprinkle the sugar in a saucepan and pour in enough water to just cover the sugar. Heat on a medium heat until the sugar has melted and turned a rich amber color. You can swirl the pan every so often, but resist stirring. Remove from the heat, then divide the caramel between the ramekins, working quickly.
3.  Preheat the oven to 150 C / 300 F
4.  Whisk the eggs and egg yolks together with the sugar, just to combine. Don't let them become foamy and mousse-like. Strain the milk and gradually incorporate it into the egg and sugar mixture — again, don't whisk, just stir. Leave to stand while the caramel sets. If after 15-20 minutes, the top is still a bit on the bubbly side, lightly skim it.
5.  Pour the custard over the caramel, then cover each ramekin with foil. Put into a large roasting tin and pour in just-boiled water — it should come up to two-thirds of the way up the sides of the ramekins.
6.  Cook the creme caramels in the oven for 15 minutes, then remove the foil and cook for a further 15 minutes, or until the custard still has a slight wobble in the middle. Remove the ramekins form the roasting tin and leave to cool completely, then cover and leave to chill in the refrigerator.
7.  To serve, run a palette knife around the inside of each ramekins and upturn onto serving plates. The caramel should spill over the sides and pool around the set custard.

## Note

Mandarin has a great affinity with aniseed notes — I love it with basil too, for the same reason — but you can omit it if it does not appeal.
