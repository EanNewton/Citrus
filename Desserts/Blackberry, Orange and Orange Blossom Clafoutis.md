## Steps

1.  Put the blackberries in a bowl and sprinkle over the sugar and creme de mure. Leave to stand for an hour.
2.  Preheat the oven to 180 C / 350 F. Spread the butter over the base of a shallow ovenproof dish (between 21 and 23 cm). Mix the orange zest and demerara sugar together and sprinkle this over the butter. Make sure the dish is evenly covered.
3.  Put the flour in a mixing bowl with the caster sugar and salt. Give a quick whisk to get rid of any lumps. In a separate bowl, mix together with milk, cream, melted butter, orange zest and juice, orange blossom water and liqueur, if using. Make a well in the middle of the flour and sugar, then break in the eggs. Using a whisk, work in the flour, incorporating from the edge of the well, until you have a thick paste, then gradually incorporate the wet ingredients. (You can instead put everything in a food processor and blend.)
4.  Spoon the blackberries into the prepared dish, straining them a little as you go, and making sure they are evenly spread. Pour over the batter and bake in the oven for around 25-30 minutes until slightly puffed up and a light golden brown — it should still be slightly wobbly in the middle.
5.  Mix the icing sugar and orange zest together. Let the clafoutis cool a little, then sprinkle over the sugar and zest mixture. Serve with pouring cream.
