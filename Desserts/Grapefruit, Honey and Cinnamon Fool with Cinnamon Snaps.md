## Steps

1.  Mix together the honey, sweet wine, grapefruit zest and juice and the cinnamon — you should find it will end up the texture of a thinnish syrup. Add a dash of bitters if you like. Start whisking the cream until increasing in volume and becoming soft and billowy. Pour in the honey and grapefruit mixture and continue whisking for as short a time as possible — you don't want this remotely stiff. Add a little more grapefruit juice if it firms up too much. Pour into individual glasses.
