## Steps

1.  Generously butter 8 individual-sized pudding basins and set aside. Put the flour and salt into a bowl, then rub in the suet and butter. Gradually add the milk, cutting it in with a knife until you have a fairly soft, but roll-able dough. Knead lightly to make sure it is well combined (it will not be very smooth because of the suet) and not sticky, then turn out onto a floured surface. Divide the mixture into 8 — the easiest way to do this is by weighing it and dividing accordingly. Roll each piece of dough into a round, then cut a quarter of it. Use each larger piece of the circle to line the pudding basins.
2.  Cut up the butter for the filling into small squares and divide each half of it between the 8 basins. Follow with half the demerara sugar and stem ginger. Stand the kumquats or limequats upright in the center of the butter and sugar. Cover with the rest of the butter, sugar and ginger. Form the remaining pieces of dough into rounds and use to cover the puddings, make sure you seal the edges together.
3.  Cover each of the puddings with pleated foil and tie firmly around the rim — if you have a supply of rubber bands, these are the easiest things to use. Steam for around 2 hours until golden brown. When you are ready to serve, turn out and serve with pouring cream or creme anglaise.

## Variation
If you would like to make the classic Sussex pond pudding, use the same amount of suet pastry to line a 2 liter / 3 1/2 pint basin. Use all the butter and sugar in the same way, omitting the stem ginger, and use 1 whole lemon, orange, or perhaps a couple of limes, making sure you pierce them all over with a skewer. Steam for 3 1/2 to 4 hours.
