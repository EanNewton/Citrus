## Steps

1.  First make the pastry. Put the flour and salt into a bowl. Rub in the butter until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs, then stir in the icing sugar. Add the egg yolks and work everything together, adding a few drops very cold water if it is too crumbly. Wrap in plastic wrap and leave to rest in the refrigerator for 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 180 C / 350 F.
2.  On a lightly floured work surface, roll out the pastry as thinly as you can and use it to line a 23 cm fluted tart tin, making sure it is pushed well into the edges (use a bit of dough to do this). Trim the edges a little, then put in the freezer for 10 minutes. Prick the pastry with a fork, then cover with baking parchment. Pour in the baking beans and bake for 15 minutes. Remove the baking beans and parchment then return to the oven for a further 5 minutes. Leave to cool and turn the oven down to 150 C / 300 F.
3.  To make the filling, beat the eggs and caster sugar together briefly using a balloon whisk, just to combine thoroughly, then add the cream, lemon zest and juice. Pour carefully into the pastry case — the easiest way to this is to put the tart tin on a baking tray in the oven, pull out slightly, and pour directly in from a jug, so you don't have to carry it.
4.  Bake for around 30-40 minutes until just set — it should have a slight wobble. Do not worry if it has souffled up a little — this can sometimes happen, but it will soon deflate back down. Leave to cool.
5.  If you want to brulee the tart before serving, either preheat your grill to its highest setting or use a kitchen blowtorch — from a distance — until the sugar has melted, caramelized and set hard.

## Note
The bruleed top is entirely optional here. I do sometimes like that extra bitter hit, but just as often I don't. So don't feel obliged to invest in a blowtorch.
