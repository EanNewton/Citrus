## Steps

1.  Preheat the oven to 200 C / 400 F. Brush the insides of 8 small pudding basins with the melted butter.
2.  Put the chocolate, butter and rum in a saucepan and melt together over a very low heat. If you are nervous about doing this over a direct flame, you can instead put everything in a bowl and place it over a simmering saucepan of water. The butter will melt first and at this stage you can remove it from the heat as it should be hot enough to melt the rest of the chocolate. Stir thoroughly and allow to cool slightly.
3.  Put the sugar, whole eggs and egg yolks into a large bowl and whisk until the mixture has reached the ribbon stage — it should be at least doubled in volume, very aerated, and when you drizzle a line of the mixture across the surface it should take a while to melt back into the whole.
4.  Pour the chocolate and butter mixture into the egg mixture gradually, then sift over the flour. Stir everything together, slowly and gently, until the mixture is fully combined and a dark rich ochre color.
5.  Put a heaped tablespoon of mixture in each of the pudding basins, then rest a candied limequat in the center. Divide the rest of the mixture between the basins. Place on a baking tray and bake for around 10-12 minutes. When cooked, the top should be springy to touch and they should have very slightly shrunk away from the sides.
6.  Meanwhile, make the lime syrup. Put the sugar, lime zest and juice into a small saucepan and heat until the sugar has melted. Simmer for a few minutes until syrupy then add the salt and alcohol. Simmer for another minute and decant to a jug.
7.  To serve the puddings, run a palette knife around the edge of each basin and upturn onto a serving plate or bowl. Pour over the syrup at the table and serve with whipping cream too, if you like.


## Note
If you haven't any candied limequats, don't worry — just miss them out as this pudding is superb with just the lime syrup.
