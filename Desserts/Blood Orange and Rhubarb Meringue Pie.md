## Steps

1.  First make the pastry. Either whiz the flour and butter in a food processor or rub in by hand until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs, then add the egg yolk and salt. Mix briefly, adding a little chilled water if necessary, until you can bring the pastry together into a ball -- it should need no more than a tablespoon. Wrap in plastic wrap and chill for at least 30 minutes in the refrigerator.
2.  Preheat oven to 190 C / 375 F.
3.  Roll out the pastry on a lightly floured work surface and use to line a pie dish (between 21 and 23 cm / 8 1/4 to 9 inch diameter). Prick all over with a fork, then line with baking parchment and fill with baking beans. Bake for 20 minutes, then remove the beans and bake for a further 5 minutes or so until the pastry is a light golden brown. Remove from the oven.
4.  To make the filling, put the rhubarb into a baking dish, sprinkle with the sugar and orange zest and roast in the oven for 30-35 minutes, stirring every so often -- if you are organized you can cook this at the same time as you are blind baking the pastry. Strain the rhubarb juice into a measuring jug and set aside the solids. Add enough blood orange juice to make up the rhubarb juice to 250 ml / 1 cup plus 1 tbsp. Use a small amount of the liquid to whisk the cornstarch into a thin paste in a bowl, and heat the rest in a medium saucepan. When the liquid is hot, pour some over of it over the cornflour mixture, whisking constantly, then pour this back into the saucepan. Stir over a low heat until the mixture thickens -- this is likely to happen very suddenly. Add the egg yolks and butter, if using, and continue to whisk. Remove from the heat and stir through the reserved rhubarb. Pour into the cooked pastry case. If you have time, leave it to cool and chill down completely as it will help the texture enormously and prevent possible separation.
5.  To make the meringue, whisk the egg whites in a large bowl until well aerated and just starting to form stiff peaks. Continuing to whisk, add the sugar a tablespoon at a time until the meringue is beautifully stiff and glossy, then add the remaining sugar all at once, and sprinkle in the cream of tartar. Pipe or pile the meringue over the filling.
6.  Bake in the oven for around 15-20 minutes until the meringue is a dappled golden brown. I love this both hot and cold and I don't think it needs any embellishment.
