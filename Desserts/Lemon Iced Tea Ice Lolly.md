# Lemon Iced Tea Ice Lolly

Makes about 8

---

## Ingredients

* 15 g loose black tea (a good English breakfast tea is fine)
* Pared zest and juice of 1/2 lemon
* 500 ml / 2 cups water, preferably filtered
* 50 g granulated sugar
* 8 thin slices of lemon (optional)

## Steps

1.  Put the tea in a refrigerator-friendly receptacle with the pared zest and pour over the water. Refrigerate overnight to brew. You will find it tastes fairly strong without any of the bitter tannins.
2.  The next day, strain the tea and discard the solids. Add the lemon juice and sugar, stir until it has completely dissolved, then taste. It may need a squeeze more lemon or more sugar -- just remember that the sweetness will be weaker once frozen, so don't make it too sour.
3.  Pour the liquid into your lolly moulds. If you have the sort with the plastic reusable tops put these on straight away. Otherwise wait until the ice lolly has set hard enough to hold a wooden ice lolly stick, then put one in each. This is also the point where you would add a lemon slice, if using, but obviously do this first. Freeze until firm -- as this is a water-based lolly it should be frozen within 3-4 hours.
