* A pinch of freshly ground black pepper
* 2 oranges, segmented, peel and membrane reserved
* 200 g ricotta
* A few drops of orange blossom water

* 25 ml / 1 tbsp + 2 tsp water
* 25 g shelled pistachios, roughly chopped
* A large pinch of salt

## Steps

1.  First make the praline. Line a baking tray with baking parchment. Put the sugar and water in a small saucepan. Simmer on a low heat, stirring carefully until the sugar dissolved, then turn up the heat and allow the syrup to bubble until it is a light golden brown â€” at this point it will be on the verge of turning a deeper color and will be in danger of burning. Remove from the heat immediately and stir in the pistachios and salt. Tip out onto the baking tray and spread it out as much as possible. Leave to cool, by which point it will be hard and brittle. Blitz in a food processor to powder.
2.  Preheat the oven to 180 C / 350 F
3.  Put the figs cut side up in an ovenproof dish. Drizzle over 2 tbsp of the honey and sprinkle with the cinnamon and black pepper. Roast for around 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow to cool a little. Arrange over a large serving bowl, plate or individual serving bowls, with the orange segments.
4.  Break up the ricotta in a bowl, using a fork. Add the remaining honey and the orange blossom water, then squeeze over the reserved orange peel and membranes to extract their juice. WHisk together into a cream. Spoon alongside the salad, sprinkle with the blitzed praline and serve topped with mint leaves.
