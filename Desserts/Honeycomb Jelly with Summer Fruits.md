## Steps

1.  If you plan to turn out your jelly, lightly oil your mould or glasses or spray with cook spray.
2.  Put the lemon zest, egg yolks, gelatine, sugar and cream into a bowl and whisk until pale and thick. At the same time, heat the milk in saucepan until almost, but not quite, boiling, remove from the heat and pour over the egg yolk mixture, stirring as you go. It will help you enormously if you put your bowl on a folded tea towel to keep it steady while you do this.
3.  Rinse out the milk pan and pour the mixture into it. Cook on a very low heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture has started to thicken. This will take anything between 5 and 10 minutes and is ready when it is the consistency of creme anglaise. You should also be able to draw a line through it when it coats the back of your wooden spoon. Remove from the heat and allow to cool a little, then stir in the lemon juice.
4.  Whisk the egg whites in a bowl until they form stiff peaks. Pour the custard into the egg whites, folding gently but thoroughly until everything is well combined but you haven't knocked too much air out of it.
5.  Pour the mixture into your mould or into 6 individual glasses. Put into the the refrigerator to set â€” it will take at least 3 hours. When you are ready to serve, if turning out, dip into a bowl of hot water for a few seconds, then turn out onto a plate. Fill the center with fruit if you like and serve with thick cream, spiked or not with the limoncello.
