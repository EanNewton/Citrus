## Steps

1.  Preheat the oven to 180 C / 350 F. Butter a 1.5 liter oven dish.
2.  Put the raisins and citrus zest in a small saucepan and pour in the rum. Bring to a boil the immediately remove from the heat and leave to infuse.
3.  Spread each slice of bread with butter and a thick layer of curd, then cut each slice into 4 triangles. Arrange a layer of the triangles in the dish, butter and curd side up. Strain the raisins, reserving the rum, and sprinkle over two thirds of the raisins. Grate over a little nutmeg then layer the remaining bread slices over the top.
4.  Whisk the eggs together in a jug, then beat in the sugar and milk. Add the reserved rum. Pour this mixture over the bread, slowly and carefully — a torrent of liquid will dislodge the bread and make it float out of place.
5.  Sprinkle over the remaining raisins and the demerara sugar, then add a few more rasps of nutmeg. Leave to stand for at least 10 minutes to allow the custard to soak thoroughly into the bread, then bake in the oven for 30-40 minutes until golden brown with slightly caramelized patches from the sugar, butter and curd. Serve with pouring cream.
