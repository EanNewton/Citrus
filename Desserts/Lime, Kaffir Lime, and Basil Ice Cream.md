## Ingredients

* Finely grated zest and juice of 3 limes (about 90 ml / 6 tbsp)

## Steps

1.  Put the lime zest and half the juice in a food processor and add the lime leaves, basil leaves and stalks, and the sugar.
2.  Blitz until the mixture is green-flecked, then leave to stand for around an hour to give the flavors a chance to infuse -- the sugar will dissolve during this time.
3.  Strain the mixture then mix with the cream and the remaining lime juice. Churn in an ice-cream maker, then freeze. Remove from the freezer for around 10 minutes before you want to serve it, to allow it to soften slightly.
