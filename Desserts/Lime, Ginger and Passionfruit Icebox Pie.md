## Steps

1.  Crush the gingernut biscuits until they resemble fine breadcrumbs, either in a food processor or by putting them in a plastic bag and bashing with a rolling pin. Put into a bowl, stir in the spices, pour over the butter, mix well, then press into a 23 cm / 9 inch round tart tin, preferably a loose-bottomed one. Put into the freezer for a few minutes while you make the filling.
2.  Put the cream cheese in a bowl and break up with a wooden spoon. In a separate bowl, very lightly whip the cream to soft peaks. Add the condensed milk and the lime zest and juice to the cream cheese, and beat with an electric hand-held whisk until smooth. Gently fold in the whipped cream and beaten egg white.
3.  Pour the mixture over the cooled ginger base, then freeze for several hours. Remove from the freezer 10 minutes before you want to serve it. Whip the cream for serving with the icing sugar, then pile into the center of the pie. Drizzle over the passionfruit seeds and pulp. Serve immediately.
