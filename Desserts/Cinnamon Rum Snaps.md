---

## Ingredients

* 50 g butter, plus extra for greasing

* A pinch of salt

## Steps

1.  Preheat the oven to 180 C / 350 F. Butter 2 large baking trays.
2.  Put the butter, sugar and honey into a small saucepan and heat gently until everything has melted together. Remove from the heat and stir in the rum and the bitters, if using. Sprinkle over the flour and cinnamon with the salt, then beat everything together.
3.  Drop heaped teaspoons of the mixture onto the baking trays, spacing them out well. Cook one tray at a time, for 7-8 minutes. When the snaps have spread across the trays and are just very lightly colored, remove from the oven.
4.  Leave for a minute or two â€” the biscuits should be hard enough not to collapse, but soft enough to manipulate. Wrap each biscuit around a slim handle, making sure the edges overlap. Remove and leave to cool, then repeat with the second tray.
