## Steps

1.  Preheat the oven to 160 C / 325 F
2.  Put the lemon zest and lemon verbena leaves in a small saucepan. Cover with the water and bring to a boil, then simmer down until the water has reduced to around 75 ml / 5 tbsp. Add the cream and heat gently until warm, then remove from the heat.
3.  Meanwhile, whisk the egg yolks with the sugar and salt until very pale and mousse-like in texture — the mixture should pass the ribbon test (when you drizzle a line of the mixture across the surface it should take a while to melt back into the whole). Strain the infused cream into the egg yolks and stir to combine — at this stage do not use a whisk, because you don't want the mixture to be aerated, you need it to be smooth, dense custard. Stir until any foam from the eggs has abated.
4.  Divide between 6 ramekins. Put in a roasting tin and poor just-boiled water around the ramekins to come about halfway up. Cook in the oven for around 20 minutes until the custards are just set, with a slight wobble in the center. Remove from the oven and cool down. Transfer to the refrigerator to chill, preferably overnight.
5.  Decorate with borage flowers if you have them, and serve with little butter biscuits.
