## Steps

1.  Preheat the oven to 190 C / 375 F. Brush the insides of 6 small or 4 medium ramekins with softened butter, brushing it from base to top, as this will aid rising. Dust with sugar and set aside.
2.  Separate the eggs. Whisk the egg yolks until they are very pale, fluffy and have increased substantially in volume, then gradually whisk in half the sugar, the yuzu or lemon zest and juice, the mandarin zest and juice and the ginger.
3.  Whisk the egg whites in a large bowl until fairly stiff, then gradually add the remaining sugar. You want the mixture to be stiff and glossy, but not quite as dry as you would expect for meringues.
4.  Fold a couple of tablespoons of the egg whites into the egg yolk mixture, using a metal spoon. When the mixture is slightly loosened, incorporate the rest, in three batches, trying to keep as much of the volume as possible.
5.  Divide the mixture between the ramekins -- it should reach the top. Make sure the tops of the souffles are flat (you can do this with a palette knife), then run a finger round the rim of each.
6.  Put the ramekins into a toasting tin. Put in the oven, then pour just-boiled water around them -- it should come halfway up. Bake for 15-20 minutes, depending on the size of the ramekins you have used. The souffles should be well risen and golden brown.
7.  These can be eaten immediately. Alternatively, cool and chill -- they shouldn't collapse.
