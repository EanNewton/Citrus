## Steps

1.  Lightly oil a 20 cm square sided tin. Line with plastic wrap and lightly oil again.
2.  put the granulated sugar into a saucepan with 600 ml / 2 1/2 cups water and the zest. Heat slowly, stirring constantly, until the sugar has dissolved, then turn up the heat and bring to a boil. Turn down slightly then leave to bubble away until you have a syrup that has reached the hard ball stage — you want to be between 118 and 121 C / 245 and 250 F. This will take around 15 minutes. Add the juice.
3.  Meanwhile, put the cornflour (cornstarch) and cream of tartar into a saucepan with 500 ml / 2 cups + 2 tbsp water, making sure you whisk out any lumps. Heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture comes to the boil. Keep stirring until it is well thickened, then remove from the heat.
4.  Strain the sugar syrup to remove the citrus zest, then pour a small amount into the cornflour mix, whisking it in thoroughly. Gradually incorporate the rest of the sugar syrup until you have a smooth paste. Return to the heat and bring to a boil. Turn down the heat until the mixture is very gently simmering then stir constantly and steadily for an hour, or until the mixture is very thick, and when you scrape a spoon across the bottom of the pan, it leaves a clean trail behind it.
5.  To test whether the Turkish delight is done, take a small amount and drop it into a bowl of cold water. When it has cold down, remove and give it a squeeze — if it is pliable but stays in a firm, unyielding lump without breaking apart, it is done. Add the rose water and stir over the heat for another minute or two until it is well combined. Immediately pour into the prepared tin, spreading it out as evenly as possible, then leave to cool.
6.  Mix the icing sugar with the cornflour — this will help stop the icing sugar from melting over time. Cut the cooled Turkish delight into lumps and toss in the icing sugar mixture.
7.  Store in a lined box that has plenty of ventilation — if you keep it anywhere airtight it will start bleeding until it all runs together in a sticky mess.

## Variations

These are endless, but my favorite is lime or sour orange with orange blossom water. Simply substitute the citrus and use orange blossom water in place of the rose water. Another option is using lemon verbena leaves in place of the zest. In this instance continue to use the lemon juice.
