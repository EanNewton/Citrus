# Honey Bears

Makes about 60 small or 24 large

---

## Ingredients

* 30 g leaf gelatine
* 60 ml / 1/4 cup lemon, lime, grapefruit, sour orange or yuzu juice
* 50 g / 3 tbsp runny honey
* Finely grated zest of 1/2 lemon or lime
* A pinch of ground ginger, cinnamon and turmeric (optional)

## Steps

1.  Soak the leaf gelatine in plenty of cold water until soft.
2.  Meanwhile, put the citrus juice, honey, zest and spices, if using, into a saucepan and heat gently until the honey is completely liquid. Wring out the leaf gelatine and add to the pan. You will find it melts into the liquid very quickly, but stir for a few moments until you are sure no lumps remain.
3.  Decant the liquid into a fine-lipped jug and pour the mixture into the bear moulds — unless you have a pipette, in which case use that instead. Leave to set. When they are completely non-tacky, you can peel them out of their moulds and store in an airtight container. They should have a good bounce to them.

## Variation

If you want to use sweeter juices, I find that sugar works better than honey — also the flavor needs concentrating a little. For sweet orange, mandarin, or clementine bears, take 100 ml / 7 tbsp juice and reduce it to 45 ml / 3 tbsp. Add 15 ml / 1 tbsp lemon juice and just 30 g sugar. Simmer together until the sugar has melted, then proceed as above.
