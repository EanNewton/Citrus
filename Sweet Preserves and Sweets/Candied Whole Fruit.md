---

## Ingredients

* Approximately 300 g small citrus fruit
* 150 g granulated sugar
* 100 ml / 1/3 cup water

---

## Steps

1.  Put the fruit in a saucepan and cover with cold water. Bring to a boil and simmer for 5 minutes then drain. Re-cover with water and bring to a boil again. Repeat this process once more â€” do not skimp, as it will result in a too bitter / rough fruit.
2.  Put the sugar in a saucepan with the water. Heat slowly until the sugar has dissolved, then bring to a boil. Turn down and simmer gently for 10 minutes.
3.  Take each fruit and pierce it a few times with a skewer or knife tip. Add the fruit to the syrup and simmer until tender, 15-20 minutes. Remove from the heat, cover and leave overnight.
4.  The following day, return the saucepan to the heat and bring to the boil again. Simmer for a further 10 minutes. While still hot, decant into a warmed sterilized jar. Cool and refrigerate.
