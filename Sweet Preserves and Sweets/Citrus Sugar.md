## Steps

1.  The slow method for this is simply infusing sugar with citrus peel. use fresh or dried pieces of pared zest and drop it into bags or jars of sugar. Leave, shaking or turning regularly so the zest can move around. For a more subtle flavour, just use leaves leaves when you have them.
2.  For a fine sugar — if you use granulated sugar, you will end up with either caster sugar or icing sugar depending on how long you process it — simply blitz with very fine, freshly microplaned zest or dried zest in a high-speed blender, or in batches in a coffee grinder. You can also do this with dried lemon verbena or kaffir lime leaves. Store in an airtight container, indefinitely.
