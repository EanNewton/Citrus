## Steps

1.  Blitz 50 g of the sugar with the citrus zest in a small food processor â€” this will give a good uniformity of flavor to the lollies. Put the blitzed sugar and zest, the remaining sugar and the golden syrup in a small saucepan. Add the cream of tartar and water.
2.  Warm gently, stirring constantly, until the sugar and syrup have melted, then turn up the heat and bring to a boil. Keep it going until the syrup reaches 154 C / 309 F, then remove from the heat.
3.  Divide the syrup between the lolly moulds and add the lolly sticks. If you don't have lolly moulds, dollop spoonfuls onto greased baking parchment, making sure you leave enough space to place a lolly stick on each one. Leave the lollies to cool completely before removing them from the moulds or baking parchment.
4.  For the sherbet, simply take a quantity of candied citrus zest along with the sugar and citric acid it is stored with. Make sure it is completely dry, then blitz to a fine powder in a small food processor. Taste, and add a little more citric acid or sugar as you think necessary.
