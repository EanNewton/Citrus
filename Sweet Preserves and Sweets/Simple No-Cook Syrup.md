## Steps

1.  Just take some citrus shells that have been left over from juicing and even zesting. Roughly chop up further if you like; it isn't essential. Weigh the peels and put in a bowl. Weigh out the peels and put in a bowl. Weight out half the weight of the peels in sugar, and sprinkle this over the peels. Cover with a tea towel or similar and leave to steep for at least 3 hours, longer if you can, stirring every so often. The sugar will dissolve in this time and take on the flavour and aroma of the citrus
2.  Scald a piece of muslin with freshly boiled water, and use to double line a sieve or strainer. Strain the syrup, giving the peels a good squeeze as you go. Decant into sterilized bottles and store in the refrigerator.
