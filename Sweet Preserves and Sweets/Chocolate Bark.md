## Steps

1.  Lightly oil a small, half-sized (about 20 cm) baking tray.
2.  Break up the chocolate into fairly even pieces and put 200 g of it into a heatproof bowl. Set the bowl over a pan of simmering water, making sure the bowl does not touch the water. Melt the chocolate until it is liquid, then remove the bowl from the pan. Add the remaining chocolate, add a sugar thermometer and stir the chocolate until it reaches 30-32 C / 86-89 F for dark or milk chocolate or 27-28 C / 80-82 F for white chocolate. At this point your chocolate is ready to use and you will need to act quickly.
3.  Pour the chocolate onto the baking tray and spread it evenly with a spatula. Sprinkle over a choice of flavors:

    * For dark chocolate, I like either candied orange or grapefruit peel with finely chopped nuts (hazelnuts or pistachios work best).
    
    * For milk chocolate, I like candied lime with salt, or candied orange with [candied fennel seeds](https://github.com/EanNewton/Citrus/blob/master/Sweet%20Preserves%20and%20Sweets/Candied%20Fennel%20Seeds.md). 
    
    * For white chocolate, try candied lemon peel, perhaps with a few rose petals dotted about.

4. When the chocolate has set, break it up into pieces as you like, or cut into bars. Store somewhere cool
