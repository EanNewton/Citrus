## Steps

1.  Put the sugar and water in a saucepan. Melt the sugar over a low heat until completely dissolved then turn up the heat and boil for 2-3 minutes until the mixture has bubbled up and turned syrupy. Add the fennel seeds and salt. Stir until the mixture suddenly turns from sticky to powdery. As soon as this has happened, remove from the heat and stir until all the seeds are completely separate from one another and coated in a powdered sugar. These are very versatile on their own, but you can also add dried citrus to them if you like -- try blitzed lemon zest.
