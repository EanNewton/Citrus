## Steps

1.  Pare the zest from the fruit in thick strips — don't worry if a little pith is attached to the zest, this is to be expected. Slice the strips thinly, just slightly thicker than you would get if you used a parer.
2.  Put the zest in a small saucepan and cover with cold water. Bring to a boil then immediately strain. Run under cold water, then repeat the process. Set aside the drained zest while you make the sugar syrup.
3.  Put the sugar and water in a suacepan. Heat slowly, stirring until the sugar has completely dissolved. Add the zest and bring a boil. Turn down and simmer gently for 10-15 minutes until the zest is translucent.
4.  Remove the zest from the syrup with a slotted spoon and spread out on kitchen paper or a piece of baking parchment. Leave to dry for around an hour.
5.  To store, sprinkle with sugar and keep in an airtight container. What I normally do is pound a little citric acid in a pestle and mortar until it as powdery as icing sugar, and mix this with the sugar — it will make the flavors pop and will really enhance the sour qualities of the zest.

## Tip

The leftover syrup can also be used for syrup or sweets. Add some citrus juice and simmer for a few minutes to make a syrup for desserts and ice cream, or to pour over ice chips. 

And if you have a sugar thermometer you can then use this syrup to make sweets: simply heat until it reaches 149 C / 300 F, then pour onto some greased baking parchment. It will cool quickly — when it is cool enough to touch, pick it up in one large piece and work / pull it into a rope. Fold it back on itself and twist, then repeat until it feels as though it is too firm to continue without it snapping — you want to end up with a long twist around 1.5 cm / 1/2 inch thick. Then cut it into sweets with scissors or a sharp knife.
