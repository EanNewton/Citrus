## Steps

1.  Put the whole oranges into a preserving pan or large saucepan and cover with the water. Bring to a boil, then turn down and simmer for up to 1 1/2 hours, until the oranges have softened -- you should be able to easily pierce the skin with the handle of a wooden spoon. Leave to cool.
2.  When the oranges are cool enough to handle, scoop out the pips and the worst of the white membrane. Pile these into a square of muslin, then tie into a bundle. Return this to the pan and simmer the liquid for a further 10 minutes.
3.  Chop the orange peel -- I do this in a fairly small dice rather than strips. Add this to the pan along with the stem ginger, lime zest and juice, and lemon juice. Finally, add the sugars. Stir on a low heat until the sugar has dissolved, then turn up to a rolling boil. Check for setting point quite quickly -- after 5 minutes -- and at intervals.
4.  When setting point has been reached, take off the heat and leave the marmalade to stand until it has cooled and thickened slightly. Pour in the rum and bitters, then stir once more to make sure the peel is evenly distributed. Ladle into sterilized jars and seal.
