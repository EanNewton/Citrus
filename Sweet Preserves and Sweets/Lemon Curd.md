# Lemon Curd

Makes 1 large jar

---

## Ingredients

* 200 ml / 3/4 cup lemon juice (or other citrus)
* Finely grated zest of 2 lemons (or other citrus)
* 150 g caster sugar
* 125 g unsalted butter
* 2 eggs, plus 3 egg yolks

## Steps

1.  Put all the ingredients into a saucepan. Cook very slowly, stirring regularly, until the sugar has dissolved and the butter has melted -- it will not look pretty for a while, and may even look slightly curdled, but don't worry, it will suddenly start to homogenize.
2.  Continue to cook on a low heat, making sure you stir constantly, otherwise any eggs in contact with the base of the pan will start to set. You will have to stir for anything from 10-20 minutes to get the right consistency -- when it is ready it should thickly coat the back of your spoon and be slightly thicker than a creme anglaise. Push through a sieve into a bowl or a large sterilized jar and leave to cool -- you will find it will thicken to a spreadable consistency as it does so.
