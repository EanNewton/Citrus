Makes about 4 x 225 g / 1/2 lb jars

---

## Ingredients

* 3 clementines (left whole)
* 1 large quince, roughly chopped (unpeeled and with seeds)
* 1 small Bramley apple
* 2 tbsp dried rose petals
* 1/2 cinnamon stick
* Sugar (see method below for amount)

## Steps

1.  Put all the ingredients except the sugar into a saucepan and just cover with water. Bring to a boil and simmer until the fruits are very soft -- when you can push a wooden spoon handle through the clementines without resistance it will be done, probably around an hour (alternatively, pressure cook for 10 minutes). Mash everything up a little to break up the clementines, then put into a jelly bag and strain until the pulp is quite dry -- you will probably need to do this overnight.
2.  Weigh the liquid. Put this in a preserving pan or large saucepan and add the same weight of sugar. Stir over a low heat until the sugar has dissolved, then bring to a boil and keep boiling until setting point is reached -- 105 C / 221 F. Allow the bubbles to subside. Stir to disperse any foam -- if it is proving resistant, spoon it off instead. Decant into sterilized jars, cool then seal.
