# Lime and Lemon Marmalade

Makes about 4 x 450 g / 1 pound jars

---

## Ingredients

* 250 g limes (3-4)
* 125 g lemons (1-2)
* 900 ml / 4 cups water
* 750 g granulated sugar

---

## Steps

1.  Cut all the limes and lemons in half and juice them. Put the juice in a preserving pan or large saucepan with the water. Scrape the membranes out of the citrus fruit -- the easiest way to do this is to cut the halves in half again, lay them flat, and cut through the pith and peel it away.
2.  Put the membranes and pulp in a piece of muslin or a jelly bag, secure firmly and put in the pan with the juice. Very finely slice the peel add it to the pan. If you have time, cover and leave to stand overnight or for at least a few hours.
3.  When you are ready to make the marmalade, put the pan on the heat and bring to the boil. Keep it covered, turn down the heat and leave to simmer for around 2 hours until the peel has softened.
4.  Put the oven on at its lowest temperature. Put the sugar in a roasting tin and put in the oven to warm -- this will help it dissolve faster, resulting in less foam and clearer jelly.
5.  Remove the bag of membranes and pulp from the pan, after squeezing it against the side to extract as much juice as possible. Discard. Add the warmed sugar to the pan. Cook on a low heat, stirring until it has dissolved, then turn up the heat and allow the marmalade to boil until it reaches setting point -- between 7 and 10 minutes.
6.  Remove from the heat. When bubbling has subsided, remove any scum, then leave the marmalade to cool for around 10 minutes. Give it a good stir to evenly distribute the peel throughout the jelly, then decant into sterilized jars. Cover and leave to cool.

## Note

The time your marmalade takes to reach setting point can vary  depending on the levels of pectin in the fruit used. To test, chill a saucer or plate in the refrigerator, then spoon onto it a tablespoon of the boiled marmalade. Allow to cool a little, then run your finger across the surface of the marmalade. If it wrinkles down then it has setting point; if not, then continue to boil and test again. If you have a jam or sugar thermometer, you're looking for a temperature of 105 C / 221 F.
