## Steps

1.  Wash the barley, then put in a saucepan with the pared zest. Cover with cold water, bring to a boil and boil for 3 minutes — this will help remove any bitterness from both the barley and the zest. 
2.  Strain and put the barley and zest into a jug. Cover with the boiling water, then stir in the honey or sugar until dissolved. Leave to infuse until the water has cooled down, then strain, discarding the barley and zest. Keep in the refrigerator.
