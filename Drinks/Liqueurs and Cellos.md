# Liqueurs and Cellos

Makes about 1 litre / 2 pints

---

## Ingredients

* 7 citrus fruits (I recommend lemon, blood or sour orange, bergamot, mandarin, yuzu; you need 1 fruit for every 75 ml / 5 tbsp of alcohol, 2 if they are particularly small)
* 500 ml / 2 cup plus 2 tbsp vodka or white rum
* 400 g granulated sugar
* 400 ml / 1 3/4 cup filtered water

## Steps

1.  Zest the fruit, either with a microplane or in strips with a swivel peeler. Put in a sealed glass container with the vodka or rum. Leave to infuse at room temperature for several days, or up to 3 weeks. The rule of thumb is that no more flavour is to be had once the zest has turned white, but this isn't exact. I find 5-7 days will give quite a pronounced flavor, making this a very useful recipe if you want fast results.
2.  Make a sugar syrup. Put the sugar and water in a saucepan. Heat gently, stirring constantly until the sugar has dissolved, then leave to simmer for 15 minutes. Remove from the heat and cool.
3.  Start mixing the sugar syrup and infused alcohol. I start with the same amount of syrup to alcohol, mixing thoroughly and tasting. Add more sugar syrup until you are happy with the flavour â€” the more you add, the smoother and sweeter your cello will become.
4.  Decant into a jug and pour into sterlized bottles.
