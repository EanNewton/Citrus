## Steps

1.  Take 2 tea bags or 2 teaspoons of loose leaf tea along with the freshly pared zest of a lemon, then pour over 1 litre / 4 cups freshly boiled water. Add ginger or mint as well if you like. 
2.  Leave to infuse for 2-3 minutes or until it is a little stronger than you would normally brew it (this because it will be diluted). Strain then add the juice of a lemon.
3.  Taste and start adding sugar or honey to sweeten â€” again, you will need a little more than you think, because it will taste sweeter while still hot or warm. Leave until it is completely cool, then serve over ice with lots more mint leaves and slices of lemon.
