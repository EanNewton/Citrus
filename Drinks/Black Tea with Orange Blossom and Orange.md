## Steps

1.  For each person, use a teaspoon of black tea and add a teaspoon of dried orange blossoms. Steep until the tea is the strength you like. Serve with a slice of orange, another pinch of orange blossom, and honey to taste.
2.  This is also a lovely cold-brewed and is very refreshing on a hot day. Put a teaspoon of black or white tea in a bottle with a piece of dried orange zest and a teaspoon of orange blossom flowers. Leave for several hours or overnight then strain and serve in glasses over ice.
