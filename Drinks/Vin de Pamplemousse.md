## Steps

1.  Preheat your oven to 150 C / 300 F. Put the grapefruit and lemon peel on a baking sheet and put in the oven for around 45 minutes to an hour until it is dry, aromatic and just starting to brown.
2.  Put the peel into a large sterilized jar or wide-lipped bottle with the pieces of vanilla pod and cinnamon stick. Add the remaining ingredients, then seal, making sure it is airtight. Leave somewhere cool and dark for 4-6 weeks, turning regularly to ensure the sugar dissolves properly. Start tasting after 4 weeks. When you are happy that the grapefruit flavour shines through, strain the liquid through blanched muslin or a coffee filter into sterilized bottles. Once opened, keep refrigerated.
