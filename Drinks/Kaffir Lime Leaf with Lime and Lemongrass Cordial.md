## Steps

1.  Put the lime leaves, zests, juices, and lemongrass into a large sterilized heatproof bowl and add the discarded citrus shells too. Put the water and sugar in a saucepan and heat slowly until the sugar has completely dissolved. Bring to a boil then simmer for 5 minutes.
2.  Pour the sugar syrup over the ingredients in the bowl and continue as for Mandarin, Lime, and Basil Cordial.

## Cocktail Suggestion

Take 2 tablespoons cordial and add either 1 tablespoon crème de mûre or muddle in a handful of ripe blackberries. Add a shot of vodka and top with prosecco or sparkling water: two very different drinks, both excellent.
