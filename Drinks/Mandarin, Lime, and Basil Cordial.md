## Steps

1.  Measure the mandarin and lime juices — they should come to around 240 ml / 1 cup. Put the zests, juice and black peppercorns into a sterilized heatproof bowl or jug. Put the basil stems in a saucepan and pour over the water and sugar. Heat slowly until the sugar has completely dissolved. Bring to a boil then simmer for 5 minutes.
2.  Pour the hot syrup over the contents of the bowl. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, then leave to stand for at least 12 hours.
3.  Scald some muslin and use it to double line a sieve or colander. Strain the syrup into a jug, then pour it into sterilized bottles. Seal and store somewhere cool. Once you have opened it, it is best kept in the refrigerator.


## Cocktail Suggestion

I don't think you can improve on simply mixing this with prosecco. however, you could make a rum-based drink, similar to a mojijto, using this cordial in place of sugar.
