# Orange and Coffee Liqueur

Makes about 1 litre / 2 pints

---

## Ingredients

* 2 Seville oranges
* 44 (6 g / 1 heaped tbsp) medium roast coffee beans
* 44 tsp (250 g) sugar 
* 1 litre / 4 cups golden rum

---

## Steps

1.  Wash and dry the oranges thoroughly. Cut slits evenly over the orange skin and push the coffee beans in. Put in a large preserving jar and cover with the sugar. Pour over the rum and seal.
2.  Leave to steep for 44 days (6 weeks) then strain into clean, sterilized bottles. Do not leave this for longer as I did the first time I made it — the bitter notes will become too dominant.

## Cocktail Suggestion
* This is a good sipping drink, but I also like making an orange version of a "Black Lemon" — so the "Black Orange", if you will — a take on the vodka martini. Simply take 1 shot of this liqueur, 1 shot of espresso, and 2 shots of frozen vodka. Shake over ice then strain into a frozen glass and garnish with a twist of pared orange.
