## Steps

1.  Preheat your oven to 220 C / 425 F
2.  Put the flour in a bowl with the baking powder and yeast. Mix briefly then add the salt, honey, water and olive oil. Mix until you have a smooth dough, resisting the temptation to add extra flour, then turn out onto a work surface. Knead for a couple of minutes, then return to the bowl, cover with a damp cloth or plastic wrap and leave for around 30 minutes.
3.  Divide the dough into 6 or 12 pieces, depending on how long you want them to be, then roll each into a lozenge shape. Lay out over 2-3 baking trays, then prick all over with a fork, brush with oil and sprinkle with the lemon zest and some za'atar and sumac.
4.  Bake for 10-12 minutes until crisp and turning a rich ochre color. Dust with a little more za'atar and sumac if you like.
