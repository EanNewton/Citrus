## Steps

1.  To make the bean cakes, preheat the oven to 200 C / 400 F. Heat the oil in a frying pan and saute the onion and red bell pepper until lightly caramelized and softened. Add the garlic and cook for another minute, then stir in the spices and lime zest. Remove from the heat.
2.  Take half the beans and either mash or whiz in a food processor until well broken down, then scrape into a bowl. Very lightly crush the rest of the beans, using a masher, and add these to the other beans along with the contents of the frying pan, the quinoa (if using), and the coriander. Season well with salt and pepper, then combine thoroughly. Divide into 12 even-sized patties and arrange on a large baking tray. Brush both sides with olive oil then bake for 12-15 minutes until lightly browned.
3.  While the bean cakes are baking, make the salsa. Put the lime zest and juice into a bowl. Peel the mango or papaya, scraping out the seeds if using papaya, then cut the flesh into dice. Add to the bowl with the spring onions and coriander, then season well with salt and pepper. Stir together.
4.  Make the crema by stirring together the soured cream or creme fraiche, lime juice, and chilli powder along with a generous pinch of salt.
5.  Serve the bean cakes with the salsa and crema and a sprinkling of chopped coriander.
