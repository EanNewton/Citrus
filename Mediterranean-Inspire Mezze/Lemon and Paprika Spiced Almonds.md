* 1 tsp smoked sea salt

## Steps

1.  If using dried lemon zest, mix it with the smoked salt and both paprikas and blitz in a small food processor until powdery. If using fresh lemon zest, preheat your oven to its lowest temperature, finely grate the zest and spread over a baking tray. Leave in the oven with the door ajar for around 30 minutes or so until dry. Cool then proceed as for dried lemon zest.
2.  Put the almonds in a single layer in a large frying pan. Toast lightly for a few minutes, stirring or shaking regularly, until golden brown. Add the olive oil, powdered zest mixture and citric acid (if using) and stir until the almonds are coated. Remove from the heat and cool before serving.
