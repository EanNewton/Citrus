## Steps

1.  Heat the coconut oil in a large, lidded frying pan. Add the onions, celery and both bell peppers, then cook for several minutes on a medium heat until starting to brown around the edges.
2.  Add the garlic, spices and oregano, then stir for a couple more minutes before adding the beans, coconut milk, and lime zest. Season with salt and pepper and cook for 5 minutes, uncovered, on a low heat. Add the sprouting broccoli or spring greens, then cover again and cook for a further 6-7 minutes until the greens are tender.
3.  Add half the lime juice and taste, then add more if you think it is necessary.
4.  Heat the olive or coconut oil in a frying pan, add the eggs and fry until they are cooked as you like, then drench in lime juice and sprinkle over some chipotle. Serve the beans and greens with the fried eggs and warm tortillas, if you like, generously garnished with cilantro leaves.
