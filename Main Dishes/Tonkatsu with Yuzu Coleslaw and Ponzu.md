## Steps

1.  First make the coleslaw. Shred the cabbage as finely as you can, then put in a colander with the carrot and spring onions. Sprinkle over the salt, sugar, and vinegar, then leave to stand over a bowl or in the sink for an hour -- this will have the effect of ridding the vegetables of any excess water and will prevent it from diluting the dressing later. Transfer the vegetables to a bowl and add the apple. Whisk together the mayonnaise, creme fraiche, yuzu juice, soy, and powdered zest, if using. Pour over the vegetables and mix thoroughly. Sprinkle with the sesame seeds.
2.  To make the tonkatsu, preheat the oven to 200 C / 400 F. Put the pork between sheets of plastic wrap and bash with a mallet or rolling pin until they are as thin as you can get without them breaking up. Put the flour on a plate and season with salt and pepper. Put the beaten eggs into a small bowl and the breadcrumbs on a separate plate. Dust each escalope with the seasoned flour, then pat off any excess before dropping into the egg wash and then the breadcrumbs. Arrange on a baking tray. Drizzle over the melted butter or oil and bake in the oven for around 10-12 minutes, by which point the pork should be cooked through and the breadcrumbs lightly browned.
3.  To make the ponzu, put the soy sauce, mirin, rice vinegar, sugar, ginger, mandarin juice and lime juice in a small saucepan. Simmer, stirring, until the sugar has dissolved, then immediately remove from the heat. Whisk in the yuzu juice and zest and strain into a small dipping sauce bowl.
4.  Serve the pork with the coleslaw on the side and ponzu for dipping.
