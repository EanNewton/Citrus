## Steps

1.  First make the meatballs. Preheat the oven to 200 C / 400 F. Put all the ingredients into a bowl, with salt and pepper to taste, and mix thoroughly. Test a small piece of mixture for seasoning by frying in a little oil in a small frying pan, and adjusting the seasoning accordingly. Form the mixture into golf-ball sized pieces, place on a baking tray and bake for around 10-12 minutes.
2.  Meanwhile, make the sauce. Heat the oil in a large flameproof casserole or wide, deep sided frying pan. Add the onion and chard stems with a squeeze of the lemon juice and saute until softened. Add the lemon zest, garlic and allspice and cook for a couple more minutes. Pour in the stock and bring to a boil. Add the broad beans, chard leaves, and two thirds of the chopped herbs. Simmer for 4-5 minutes until the vegetables are tender, then add the baked meatballs and simmer for another few minutes just to meld the flavours. Add the remaining lemon juice to taste and sprinkle with the reserved herbs.
3.  Stir the yogurt sauce ingredients together. Season with salt and pepper. Serve the meatballs with the vegetables and the yogurt sauce on the side.
