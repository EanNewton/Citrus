## Steps

1.  Put the flour in a bowl and mix in the yeast and sugar. Sprinkle over the salt. Whisk the yogurt and hot water together - you should end up with a liquid that is tepid. Add this to the flour along with the olive oil or butter. Mix thoroughly to a soft, very slightly sticky dough. Turn out onto an oiled surface and knead until the dough is smooth. Return to the bowl and cover with a damp tea towel or plastic wrap and leave to double in size.
2.  Turn out the dough again and divide into 8 even pieces. Roll into rounds of approximately 20 cm / 8 inch diameter.
3.  Heat a griddle, skillet or frying pan until it is fairly hot — you don't want it as hot as it will go or the flatbread will blister and blacken on the outside before it's cooked within, and will consequently be too hard to fold. Add a dough round and cook for 2-3 minutes on each side — it should be cooked through, lightly browned / charred and still pliable. brush with melted butter and sprinkle with seeds, if you like . Keep warm in a basket lined with a tea towel or cloth and cover while you cook the rest.
