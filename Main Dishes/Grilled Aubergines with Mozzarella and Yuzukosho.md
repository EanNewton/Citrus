## Steps

1.  First, grill or bake the aubergine slices. If you have the time to grill them on a griddle, do so, as you get the best smoky flavour that way, otherwise you can put them under a medium grill or even bake in the oven at 200 C / 400 F for 20 minutes. Whichever way you do it, brush first with olive oil and sprinkle with salt. Cook until they are browned with char lines if on a griddle, and beautifully tender within.
2.  While the aubergines are grilling, whisk the dressing ingredients together and taste. Adjust by adding more of any of the ingredients until you get the flavour you like.
3.  To finish the aubergines, put them all on a baking tray and lay the mozzarella on top. Put under a hot grill for as short a time as possible, so the mozzarella browns lightly but is still soft and not too rubbery.
4.  Meanwhile, for the greens, put the oil in a wok and heat until shimmering. Add the spring onions, garlic, chard stems and sprouting broccoli and stir fry for 2-3 minutes, until the broccoli is almost cooked. Add the chard leaves and oriental greens with a splash of water (or stock) and cook for a further minute. Add the mizuna and shiso leaves, if using, and wilt in, then stir through the lentils just to warm them. Season with salt and pepper, and a dash of soy sauce or tamari if you like.
5.  Sprinkle the mozzarella-topped aubergines with yuzu powder if you have some, and serve with the dressing, alongside the greens and lentils in a separate bowl.
