## Steps

1.  Heat the olive oil and butter in a large, shallow flameproof casserole or pan. When the butter is foaming, add the chicken thighs, skin side down, and fry until they are well browned -- do not stint on this, it will take at least 10 minutes. Remove the chicken from the pan, then add the onion and saute on a gentle heat until soft and translucent. Add the garlic and cook for a further minute or two.
2.  Turn up the heat and add the wine. Bring to a boil and allow the wine to bubble off, then stir in the lemon zest and juice and the mustard. Add the water, return the chicken to the pan, skin side up, and season with salt and pepper. Cook, partially covered, until the thighs are cooked through. Add a splash more water if necessary.
3.  Remove the chicken from the pan again then stir in the capers and basil. Spoon the sauce over the chicken and serve immediately.
