## Steps

1.  Preheat the oven to 200 C / 400 F. Prick all over the skin of the duck with a skewer or fork, making sure you focus on the fattiest parts and trying not to pierce the flesh. Put the duck on a rack in your sink and pour over 2 kettles of boiling water. Pat the duck dry, then rub over the brandy. Sprinkle with salt and finely ground white pepper.
2.  Put the Seville orange quarters inside the cavity of the duck along with half the thyme and one of the bay leaves. Put the remaining thyme in the bottom of a roasting tin and top with the onion and remaining bay leaves. Place the duck on top, breast side down, then roast for 30 minutes. Turn the duck breast side up and roast for a further 50 minutes. Remove from the oven and leave to rest. If you want to serve it jointed, this is the time to do so, otherwise you can leave it whole and carve at the table.
3.  To make the sauce, use a swivel peeler to pare the zest from one of the Seville oranges in strips, as long as you can manage. Cut into a julienne, then blanch in boiling water for 3 minutes. Juice all the oranges and set aside.
4.  Put the sugar and water in a saucepan and heat gently until the sugar has dissolved. Add the blanched orange zest and continue to cook gently for another 3-4 minutes until the mixture is syrupy. Remove the zest from the syrup, reserving it, and add the vinegar. Turn up the heat and boil until the sugar caramelizes and turns the colour of amber. Add the shallots and the orange juice. The caramel will probably seize up and spit at you, so be careful. Stir until it has dissolved again, then add the stock. Simmer until the sauce is well reduced but not too thick. Taste and adjust for seasoning — you can add a little more orange juice or stock at this point if you think it needs it.
5.  When the duck has rested, strain off any liquid from the pan and remove the fat, then add these juices to the sauce. Simmer until piping hot and add the zest back to the sauce.
