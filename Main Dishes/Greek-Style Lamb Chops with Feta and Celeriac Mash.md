## Steps

1.  Put the lamb chops in a non-reactive container. Sprinkle with salt and rub it into the flesh lightly. Mix the lemon zest and juice with the herbs, olive oil and garlic, if using, and rub this over the flesh too. Leave to marinate for a good couple of hours, overnight (refrigerated) if you are able to.
2.  To make the mash, preheat the oven to 200 C / 400 F. Put the potatoes and celeriac into a sauce pan and cover with water. Add salt, bring to the boil, then turn down and simmer until tender. Drain, add thee butter and mash together. Butter an ovenproof dish and pile the mash into it. Push the feta into the top, leaving it slightly exposed (or at least flush with the mash), then dot with a little more butter. Bake in the oven for around 20 minutes until the feta is soft and lightly browned in patches.
3.  When you are ready to cook the chops, prepare your barbecue. If you have any dried lemon peel lying around, soak for a little while in water. When the coals are white, add the lemon peel — it will add smoke and aroma. Arrange the lamb chops around the side (they need indirect heat initially) and cook for around 3 minutes on each side, basting with any dregs of marinade, then move to the center of the grill to get a decent charring. Leave for at least 5 minutes to rest before eating.
4.  For the optional garnish, heat the olive oil in a small pan and when it is very hot, throw in the capers and lemon. Toss for a few seconds — they should sizzle and brown immediately, so be careful, it might spit at you. Pour this over the mash when it comes out of the oven.
