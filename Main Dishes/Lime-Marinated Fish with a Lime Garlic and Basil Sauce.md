## Steps

1.  Put the fish fillets in a bowl and season with salt and pepper. For the marinade, mix the lime zest and juice with the garlic, chilli and wine. Pour this over the fish fillets and leave to marinate for at least an hour in the fridge.
2.  To make the sauce, put the creme fraîche in a saucepan with the garlic. Heat gently, just to loosen the creme fraîche, without allowing it to boil. Remove from the heat and leave to infuse for around 30 minutes. Strain into a clean saucepan, then whisk in the lime zest. Season with salt and taste -- you might find it needs a pinch of sugar and a squeeze of lime.
3.  To cook the fish, heat the olive oil and butter in a frying pan large enough to hold the fillets, with space to maneuver. When the butter starts to foam, remove the fish from the marinade and lightly pat dry with kitchen paper. Add to the pan and fry for 3-4 minutes until the underside is crisp and will easily come away from the base of the frying pan -- the flesh should also be opaque until halfway up the side of the fillet. Flip over and continue to cook for a further 2-3 minutes.
4.  Set aside to rest while you whisk the egg yolk into the sauce over a very gentle heat. Stir in the basil and serve the fillets with the sauce spooned over at the table.
