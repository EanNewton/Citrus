## Steps

1.  Heat a large, heavy-based frying pan and fry the duck pieces, skin side down, until they are crispy, brown and much of the fat has rendered out. You will probably have to do this in several batches.
2.  Spoon off a tablespoon of the duck fat and add it to a large flameproof casserole — the rest of the duck fat can be chilled for future use. Add the garlic and ginger and fry until they smell aromatic and are only just starting on some color. Add the rest of the ingredients, with salt and lots of pepper. Place the duck pieces, skin side up, in the cooking liquor and bring to a boil. Turn down the heat, then partially cover. Leave to cook for around 1 1/2 hours, until the duck is tender.
3.  Remove the duck from the casserole and keep warm. Try to spoon off any excess fat — if it proves tricky, you can always strain the liquid first, reserve the solids, and add them back when you have taken off the fat. Bring the liquor back to a boil and reduce until syrupy. Add the duck pieces back to the sauce, making sure they are warmed enough.
4.  Sprinkle with the spring onion greens, sesame seeds, a dash of sesame oil and cilantro. Best served with some jasmine rice and steamed or stir-fried greens.
