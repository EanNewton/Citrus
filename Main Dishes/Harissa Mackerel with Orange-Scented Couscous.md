## Steps

1.  To make the harissa, lightly toast the cumin, coriander, and caraway seeds and peppercorns in a dry frying pan until fragrant, then cool and grind to a powder. Add the chillies to the same pan and cook until the skin starts to blister on all sides. Remove, then deseed when cool enough to handle, and roughly chop.
2.  Put the spices, chilli, and all the remaining ingredients except the seasoning into a food processor and pulse, scraping down regularly, until you have a coarse paste. Season with salt and pepper then taste â€” you may want to add more heat; if so add in some cayenne.
3.  Use half the harissa to marinate the mackerel: score the mackerel 3-4 times across the skin (this helps it keep its shape when cooked), then put into a bowl and rub the harissa over it. Leave for 30 minutes.
4.  Preheat the grill to its highest setting. Put the mackerel fillets on a baking tray, skin side up. Drizzle over a little olive oil and sprinkle with salt, then grill for 5 minutes until the skin is crisp and the flesh is just cooked through.
5.  To make the couscous, finely chop or blitz the dried orange zest. Put it in a bowl with the couscous and dates and a good pinch of salt. Measure the orange juice and top it up with hot, but not boiling, water to 200 ml / 3/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon. Add the orange blossom water, then pour over the couscous and dates. Add the butter and leave to stand until all the liquid is absorbed and the couscous fluffs up well with a fork. Stir though the pistachios and parsley.
6.  Serve the mackerel fillets with the remaining harissa and the couscous on the side.
