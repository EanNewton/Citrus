## Ingredients

## Steps

1.  Put the masa harina in a bowl and pour in the water. Start mixing with a spoon, then when it starts to come together turn onto a work surface and knead until the dough is smooth. Make sure it isn't too dry — if it looks as though cracks are appearing or may appear, incorporate a little more hot water by wetting your hands and continuing to knead. Divide the mixture into 8 pieces and roll each piece into a ball.
2. If you own a tortilla press, place plastic wrap over the bottom, place a ball of dough in the center of the press then cover with more plastic wrap. Press down as firmly as you can then lift up. Carefully peel away the top layer of plastic wrap and lift off the second, taking the tortilla with it — you should have a tortilla around 15 cm / 6 inch in diameter. Don't worry if it is slightly rough around the edges, this just makes them look more rustic. If you don't have a tortilla press, use a heavy-based saucepan or frying pan instead, making sure it is placed centrally over the dough before you press down. Keep the uncooked tortillas to one side, divided by layers of plastic wrap, until you are ready to cook them.
3. To cook the tortillas, heat a heavy-based frying pan or griddle pan to medium-hot. Cook each tortilla for a minimum of 15 seconds on one side then try to lift off — if it doesn't come cleanly away, you need to cook it for slightly longer. Flip over and cook for a further 30 seconds, and again, don't remove until it will come cleanly away. Flip one last time and cook for another 15 seconds. Keep warm while you make the remaining tortillas.
