## Steps

1.  Heat the olive oil and butter in a large frying pan until the butter has melted. Add the onion, garlic and chilli and saute on a medium heat for several minutes until softening and turning a very light golden brown. Push the onion and garlic to one side and add the liver. Cook for 2-3 minutes on each side. Season with salt and pepper.
2.  Turn up the heat and add the Marsala. Allow to boil down for around 30 seconds, then add the orange segments. Take the reserved orange peel and membranes and squeeze any excess juice over the livers. Serve with some buttered sourdough toast and a sprinkling of parsley, if you like.
