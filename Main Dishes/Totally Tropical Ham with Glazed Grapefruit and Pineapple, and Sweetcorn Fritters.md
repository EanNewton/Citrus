## Steps

1.  Take advice as to whether your ham needs soaking or not. It will if particularly salty -- your butcher or the meat counter at your supermarket should be able to tell you. I tend to forget about an overnight soak and instead cover the ham in cold water, bring to the boil, then immediately pour off the liquid, recover the ham and start again.
2.  When you are ready to start cooking proper, put the ham in a pot -- you want it to be quite a snug fit -- and pour over the Ting or Lilt and the beer. Bring to a boil, skim the ham until any foam turns white, then add all the rest of the aromatics.
3.  Partially cover, then leave to simmer, fairly gently, for approximately 1 1/2 hours. By this point the ham should be tender. Strain the ham, reserving the cooking liquor, and leave to rest for 15 minutes, lightly covered with foil.
4.  Heat a large griddle pan and a frying pan. Whisk the rum with the honey and brush over the pineapple and grapefruit slices. When the griddle is too hot to hold your hand over, grill the fruit for a couple of minutes on each side until nicely caramelized with char lines.
5.  Cut the ham into thick slices. Put in the frying pan in a single layer and ladle over some of the stock. Simmer for a couple of minutes just to warm through and soften.
6.  Serve with the pineapple, grapefruit and sweetcorn fritters (see: ) or salsa.
