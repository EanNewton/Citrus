## Steps

1.  Heat the coconut oil in a large saucepan or flameproof casserole. Add the onion and saute for several minutes until starting to soften. Add the sweet potato or squash, garlic and ginger, and cook for a few more minutes. Add the cilantro stems and all the spices, then stir in the mung beans. Pour in the coconut milk and water, then bring to a boil. Season generously with salt and pepper. Simmer, covered, until the mung beans are tender, keeping an eye on it as you don't want it to get too dry. Before serving add the lemon or lime juice and sprinkle with coriander leaves.
