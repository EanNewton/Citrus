## Steps

1.  Top and tail the lemons or limes, then cut (with peel) into 1 cm / 1/2 inch dice. Put the lemons or limes in a saucepan and cover with water. Bring to the boil and simmer for 5 minutes. Drain thoroughly.
2.  Melt the coconut oil in a saucepan or flameproof casserole.Add the whole spices with the curry leaves and fry until the mustard seeds start popping. Add the grated coconut and fry for a few minutes more until it is looking lightly toasted, then add the onion, ginger, and garlic. Continue to cook for a few minutes, then add the turmeric and chilli powder
3.  Add the lemons or limes along with the water and the jaggery. Simmer until the lemons or limes are tender and the sauce is well reduced â€” it should retain its light, bright yellow. Add a splash more water if you think it needs it.
