## Steps

1.  Place the stock in a large saucepan and warm through until just below boiling point. Keep at this temperature.
2.  Heat the oil and half the butter in a large, straight sided frying pan. Add the onion and saute gently until very soft and translucent. Add the garlic, lemon zest and tarragon, if using, and continue to cook for a minute, then stir in the rice. When the rice is completely coated in the butter and oil — it will look glossy — add the wine. Turn up the heat and let the wine boil off then season with salt, and a little pepper if you like. Add half the lemon juice, then start adding the warm stock a ladleful at a time, stirring between each addition until it is incorporated you should find that when you pull your spoon through the rice you will see a clean pan base before the rice slowly flows back around it. At this point, it should be just al dente and creamy. Beat in the remaining butter, then taste and add more lemon juice if you feel the risotto needs it.
3.  For the garnish, heat the olive oil in a small frying pan. When it is very hot, add the chillies and capers and flash fry for just a few seconds. Serve this, and lots of shredded basil, with the risotto.
