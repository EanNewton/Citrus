## Steps

1.  Set aside a third of the cilantro, then puree the rest in a small food processor with the chillies, garlic and 1 tablespoon of the olive oil. If it proves resistant, add a little water.
2.  Heat the remaining oil in a large flameproof casserole. Add the onion and saute for a few minutes on a medium heat until starting to soften. Add the coriander paste and continue to cook, stirring, until it starts to brown a little. Add the meat. Cook for several minutes on a high heat, turning over regularly until the meat looks lightly browned and is completely coated in the paste. Season with salt and pepper.
3.  Pour over the citrus juices and add just enough water to cover the lamb. Bring to the boil then turn down the heat, cover and simmer gently for about 1 1/2 hours. Add the potatoes and peas and continue to cook, covered, until the potatoes are completely tender.
4.  Finely chop the remaining coriander and stir it into the casserole just before serving.
