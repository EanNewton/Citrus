## Steps

1.  Preheat the oven to 200 C / 400 F. Put the onions in the base of a roasting tin and drizzle over a tablespoon of the olive oil. Add a splash of water to the tin and roast in the oven for 10 minutes.
2.  Put the chicken thighs in a bowl and season well with salt and pepper. Rub in the mandarin and lime or lemon zest.
3.  Remove the tin from the oven and give the onions a good stir -- they should be well on their way to softening with very little color. Sprinkle over the garlic, making sure most of it falls in the center of the tin, then add the thyme and rosemary.
4.  Arrange the chicken thighs over the onions. Whisk the vermouth with the citrus juices then pour this around the chicken. Drizzle over the remaining olive oil. Roast in the oven for 45 minutes, until the chicken is cooked through with a golden skin and the liquid is syrupy.
5.  Meanwhile, make the couscous. Toss the broccoli florets with a tablespoon of the oil. Arrange on a baking tray and sprinkle with salt, the lemon zest and chilli. Put in the oven, below the chicken, preferably with some space in between the two, and roast for 20 minutes. Remove from the oven -- it should be lightly charred.
6.  To cook the couscous, heat the remaining olive oil in a saucepan. Add the couscous and toast for a few minutes. Pour in the water or stock and cook gently, stirring, until all the liquid is absorbed and the couscous is soft, about 15 minutes. Check regularly and add a little more liquid if necessary towards the end if the couscous isn't yet done.
7.  Toss the couscous with the broccoli and the almonds. Serve with the chicken, with the citrusy sauce and onions spooned over.

## Variation

You don't have to make this with giant couscous - a quick couscous, rice, or some potatoes would be just as good.
