## Steps

1.  Take off every scrap of meat you can find on the duck and put to one side. Make a stock with the carcass, adding a couple of star anise, an onion, carrot and a couple of sticks of celery, a few peppercorns and bay leaves. Include any leftover scrapings from the roasting tin as well as some pared sour orange zest. Cover with water, bring to a boil and skim, then either pressure cook for 25 minutes or simmer gently for around 1 1/2 hours. Strain and leave to chill so you can remove any fat.
2.  To make the soup, put the stock in a saucepan. Add 2 sliced garlic cloves, a 2 cm / 3/4 inch piece of fresh root ginger, finely chopped, and 1 red chilli. Slice a bunch of spring onions on the diagonal. Add the whites and reserve the greens for a garnish. Add 100 g mushrooms and 4 heads of oriental greens. Simmer and taste for seasoning. Add soy sauce and a little mirin or sake. Cook 200 g noodles according to the packet instructions and refresh under cold water to stop them cooking. Dress with a little sesame oil. Add the duck and noodles to the soup along with lots of fresh cilantro. Serve with any type of "kosho" if you have any, or make a ponzu sauce (see: ) with the spring onion greens sprinkled on top.
