## Steps

1.  Trim off any larges pieces of fat from the beef, then pat it dry if necessary and put in a large bowl. Mix the flour and mustard powder with some salt and pepper, tip the lot over the beef then toss lightly to coat.
2.  Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a large frying pan. Sear the beef on all sides, then remove.
3.  In a flameproof casserole, heat the remaining oil and the butter. Add the onion, carrot, and celery then saute on a medium heat until the vegetables have started to take on a bit of colour. Add the juniper and pared orange strips, along with the garlic, thyme, and bay. Stir for a minute, then add the seared beef.
4.  Pour over the orange juice and let it reduce almost to a syrup, then pour over the red wine. Bring to a boil then turn down the heat to its lowest setting, cover and cook for at least a couple of hours, until the beef is very tender. Remove the lid and continue to simmer to reduce the sauce, then serve with either a large pile of mashed potatoes or the [Caramelized Potatoes with Orange](https://github.com/EanNewton/Citrus/blob/master/Sides/Caramelized%20Potatoes%20with%20Orange.md).
