## Steps

1.  In a bowl, beat the eggs with the soy sauce, then mix in the corn kernels, spring onion, chilli, cilantro and lime zest. Season with salt and pepper. Sift in the flour and mix into a smooth batter. Heat a frying pan and cover the base with oil, then add dollops of the batter, well spaced out â€” you should manage to cook 5 at a time. Flatten down slightly, fry for a couple of minutes until well browned, then flip and cook for a further minute.
