## Steps

1.  For the celeriac fries, preheat the oven to 200 C / 400 F. Toss the celeriac in the olive oil and plenty of salt. Arrange over a baking tray and roast for 15-20 minutes, stirring regularly, until matchstick thing and crisp. Drain on kitchen paper.
2.  Meanwhile, to make the rub, toast the spices in a dry frying pan until they smell aromatic. Remove and transfer to a plate to cool, then grind in a pestle and mortar with 1/2 teaspoon of salt and the dried zest. Pat dry the onglet, then rub over with olive oil. Sprinkle over a tablespoon of the rub, patting it in as much as you can. Set aside for a few minutes.
3.  Heat a frying pan (preferably not non-stick) until it's too hot to hold your hand over, and add the teaspoon of olive oil. Sear the steak on all sides, making sure you allow a good crust to develop before you turn it. Remove from the pan and leave to rest for at least 10 minutes.
4.  Turn down the heat and add the butter to the pan â€” it should foam immediately. Add the shallot and saute for a few minutes to soften, then add the garlic, ginger, chillies and Szechuan peppercorns. Cook for a further minute, then pour in the orange juice, the rice wine vinegar, and the soy sauce. Simmer until the mixture is syrupy, then pour in any juices from the resting steak. Cut the steak into slices. Put on a platter and spoon over the sauce.
5.  For the salad garnish, put the orange and cucumber in a bowl with any juice squeezed from the discarded orange peel. Season with salt, and add the spring onions and shredded basil.
6.  Serve the celeriac fries over the beef with the salad on the side.
