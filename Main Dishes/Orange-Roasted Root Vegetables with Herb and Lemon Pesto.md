## Steps

1.  Preheat the oven to 200 C / 400 F
2.  Put all the vegetables in a large roasting tin. Tuck in the sprigs of thyme, pour over the orange juice and red wine vinegar. Toss to coat the vegetables, then repeat with the olive oil, orange zest and plenty of salt.
3.  Roast for 30 minutes, loosely covered with foil, then remove the foil and roast for a further 30 minutes, turning the vegetables over every so often. Drizzle over the honey, if using, then continue to roast for 15-20 minutes until the vegetables are tender and nicely browned or charred around the edges.
4.  To make the pesto, put the pistachios or almonds and coriander seeds in a food processor and blitz briefly to coarsely grind. Add all the remaining ingredients and season generously with salt and pepper. Blitz until you have a fairly coarse sauce, a little thinner than regular pesto â€” if it is very thick still, add more lemon juice or a splash of water.
5.  Make the couscous by putting it in a bowl and pouring over the water and orange juice. Add salt and a drizzle of olive oil. Leave to stand until all the liquid has absorbed and the couscous is tender, then fork through to fluff up.
6.  Serve the roast vegetables with the couscous, and pesto drizzled over both.
