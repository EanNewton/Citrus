## Steps

1.  First poach the chicken. If you don't want a very fatty broth, remove some of the chicken skin -- at least that which covers the breasts and thighs. Pull out some of the fat you will find around the cavity opening too. Put into a pot -- it should be a snug fit -- then add the aromatics and vegetables. Pour in enough water (or stock) so that the thickest part of the legs are covered. Season with salt, then bring to a boil. Skim until any foam slowly turns from mushroom grey to white. Reduce the heat to the slowest possible simmer, then cover. Simmer for 45 minutes, then remove from the heat and leave to stand for a further 15 minutes. Leave until you are ready to serve, reserving 50 ml / 3 1/2 tbsp of the cooking liquor for the sauce.
2.  For the sauce, melt the butter and add the sorrel. When it has completely collapsed into a puree, remove from the heat. In a separate pan, heat the cream and reserved chicken cooking liquor until just at boiling point. Add the cooked sorrel, then season well with salt and white pepper. Add a squeeze of lemon juice. Serve with slices of the poached chicken.
