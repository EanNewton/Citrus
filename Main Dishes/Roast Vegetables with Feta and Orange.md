## Steps

1.  Preheat the oven to 200 C / 400 F
2.  Put all the vegetables into a large roasting tin and sprinkle in the garlic cloves and oregano. Top and tail the 2 whole oranges then cut into fairly thick slices. Cut each slice into quarters. Add all this orange to the roasting tin, then pour over the orange juice. Season with salt and pepper and drizzle everything over the olive oil.
3.  Roast in the oven for 45 minutes, then turn everything over, gently. Sprinkle over the olives and dot the feta around. Roast for another 15 minutes. The feta should be soft and creamy and everything else should be on the verge of charring, but nicely soft on the bottom.
4.  Serve immediately, sprinkled with oregano and parsley, direct from the tin, or you can remove everything to a serving platter and squish the garlic cloves into the tin juices to pour over.
