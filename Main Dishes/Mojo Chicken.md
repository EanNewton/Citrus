## Steps

1.  Put all the marinade ingredients with plenty of salt into a food processor or blender and pulse until relatively smooth. Place the chicken breasts in a shallow dish, pour over the marinade, cover then leave in the refrigerator for several hours or overnight.
2.  When you are ready to cook the chicken, scrape off as much of the marinade as you can into a small saucepan. Heat your barbecue and grill the chicken for 3-4 minutes on each side until just cooked through. (Alternatively, use a griddle pan, making sure it is extremely hot when you start cooking; I heat mine for at least 10 minutes on high heat.)
3.  Meanwhile, bring the marinade to a boil and simmer for 10 minutes, adding a splash of water if it looks as though it is in danger of reducing down too far -- you don't want it too syrupy.
4.  Peel the plantain (or in practice cut through and break off the skin) and cut into slices on the diagonal, dropping them into the lime juice as you slice them. Heat the butter in a frying pan until melted, then add the plantain slices. Cook until each side is golden brown. Drain on kitchen paper.
5.  Serve the chicken with the marinade, the plantain and a few cilantro leaves as garnish.
