* 3 shallots, sliced
* 750 g / 1 lb 10 oz fresh mushrooms, preferably field, thickly sliced

## Steps

1.  Cover the dried mushrooms with the warm water and leave to soak until plumped up and softened. Strain, reserving any non-gritty soaking liquor, then roughly chop.
2.  Put the lemon pieces in a saucepan and cover with cold water. Bring to a boil and simmer for 5 minutes. Drain.
3.  Heat half the olive oil in a heavy-based flameproof casserole. Add the shallots and fry on a medium heat until softened and lightly browned. Add the potatoes and continue to cook for another 5 minutes, then add the fresh and the rehydrated mushrooms. Continue to cook for a few more minutes, then stir in the garlic, rosemary and lemon slices.
4.  Pour in the wine, vermouth or Marsala and allow to bubble down to almost nothing, then add the reserved mushroom liquor. Season with salt and pepper, then bring a boil before turning down to the gentlest of simmers. Cover and cook until the potatoes are just tender -- they and the mushrooms will braise, creating their own liquid.
5.  When the potatoes are tender, drizzle with more of the oil, then put under a preheated grill until the top layer of potatoes is golden brown. Serve with greens.
