## Ingredients

* 1 tsp allspice berries
* 1 tsp black peppercorns
* 2 cloves

## Steps

1.  Give the limes a good wash under hot water. Dry off, then top and tail quite generously. Slice the limes thinly, then arrange in a single layer over kitchen paper. Spinkle over half the salt, then cover with more kitchen paper and leave to stand for 5 hours.
2.  Turn over the lime slices (you should see that the salt has dissolved) and cover with the remaining salt, and a layer of kitchen paper. Leave for another few hours or, even better, overnight.
3.  Rinse the lime slices thoroughly to get rid of any excess salt, then put in a saucepan and cover with water. Bring to the boil, turn down and simmer very gently for around 30 minutes until the lime slices are tender but still intact. Drain carefully into a warmed sterilized jar.
4.  While you are simmering the lime slices, make the spiced syrup. Put the sugar, lime juice, and spices in a saucepan with 75ml / 5 tbsp water. Heat slowly until the sugar has dissolved, then simer until it has thickened to a syrup. This should take about as long as the lime slices.
5.  Pour the syrup over the lime slices, straining it if you like. Seal and leave for at least 3 weeks before using. After the lime slices will keep indefinitely in the refrigerator.
