## Steps

1.  Put the onions in a bowl and pour over freshly boiled water to cover. Leave to stand for 20 seconds then drain.
2.  In a small bowl, mix the lime juice with the salt. Pour over the onions, add the peppercorns and stir to combine. If serving straight away, leave to stand for at least 30 minutes. Otherwise, transfer to a sterilized jar and store in the refrigerator until needed.
3.  To serve, add the fresh herbs (choose whichever matches the dish you are serving it with) and a sprinkling of sumac.
