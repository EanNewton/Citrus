## Steps

1.  Put the sugar, flour, and ground almonds in a large bowl and add the salt. Whisk to combine and remove any lumps. Add the zest, butter, egg yolk, stem ginger, citrus peel and pine nuts, and lightly knead everything together until you have a dough.
2.  Shape the dough into a fairly flat round, then either lightly roll out or press into a 24 cm / 9 1/2 inch round tin. Chill well in the refrigerator, preferably overnight, then bring back to room temperature. Preheat the oven to 180 C / 350 F.
3.  Score lines in the dough to mark out 8 portions. Brush with the beaten egg and bake in the oven for 25-30 minutes. The dough should color only very lightly, if at all, and should still be soft when it comes out of the oven. Leave to cool, then dust with icing sugar and cut into slices, following the score lines you marked before baking. Store in an airtight container.
