## Steps

1.  Preheat the oven to 180 C / 350 F. Grease and line a 23 cm round, loose bottomed cake tin.
2.  Beat the butter, sugar and lemon zest together in a bowl, until the volume has dramatically increased and the texture is soft and airy.
3.  Mix the cornmeal or polenta with the baking powder. Add the eggs to the creamed butter and sugar one at a time with a couple of tablespoons of the cornmeal, beating well between each addition, then add the rest of the cornmeal. The mixture will be fairly dry, certainly not as loose as a dropping consistency. Don't worry, this is as it should be.
4.  Scrape the batter into the prepared cake tin and smooth over a little. Bake in the oven for around 35-40 minutes, until it is a deep golden brown and shrunk away from the sides of the cake tin.
5.  Meanwhile, make the syrup, if using. Put the lemon juice and icing sugar into a small saucepan and stir over a low heat until the sugar has dissolved and the texture is syrupy. While the cake is still hot, pierce the top all over with a cocktail stick or something similarly pointy. Pour the syrup over the cake as evenly as possible. Leave to cool completely before serving, with a dollop of creme fraiche, if you like.

## Variations

I have made this with most citrus and find lemon works best, but grapefruit (using the juice of just 1 grapefruit) also works beautifully. I also like adding other flavors to the syrup. Try finely ground cardamom with the lemon, and rosemary with the grapefruit.
