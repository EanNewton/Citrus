## Steps

1.  Preheat the oven to 180 C / 350 F. Line a cup cake tin with paper cases.
2.  Put the milk and liquorice in a small saucepan and heat very gently until the liquorice has almost completely melted. Remove from the heat and leave to cool to blood temperature.
3.  Cream the butter and sugar together in a large bowl until very light and fluffy. Whisk the lour and baking powder together just to combine and get rid of any lumps. Add the eggs to the beaten butter and sugar one at a time, adding a tablespoon of flour between each, then fold in the rest of the flour. Pour in the milk and liquorice mixture and stir until combined, then add a little more milk if the batter isn't at proper dropping consistency.
4.  Spoon the mixture into the paper cases — they should only be around half full. Bake for around 15-20 minutes, then remove from the oven and cool completely.
5.  To make the icing, blitz the candied zest with the icing sugar in a small food processor until powdery. Reserve a couple of tablespoons of this mixture for sprinkling, then add boiling water to the remainder, a teaspoon at a time, until you have a thick, spoonable glace icing — do not let it get too runny. Spoon the icing onto the cakes. When it has set, sprinkle with the reserved sugar and decorate with more candied citrus zest.
