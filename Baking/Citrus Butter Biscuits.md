## Steps

1.  Put the butter into the bowl of a stand mixer. Add the sugar, then beat until the mixture is very soft, fluffy and white. Add the grated zest and beat for another minute.
2.  Add the eggs, one at a time, with 2 tablespoons of flour in between each addition, to stop the mixture from curdling, then incorporate the rest of the flour. Do not over-work as you don't want the mixture to be too tough. If using the candied citrus zest, add it at this point too.
3.  Roll the mixture into 4 fat logs — at least 5-6 cm / 2-2.5 inches diameter. Wrap and chill in the refrigerator until you want to bake them, but for at least 2 hours.
4.  When you are ready to cook the biscuits, preheat the oven to 180 C / 350 F. Cut the biscuits in 0.5 cm / 1/4 inch slices; you should get about 12 slices from each log. Space evenly on a large baking tray then bake for 10-12 minutes, until a very light golden brown. Remove and transfer immediately to a cooling rack, and sprinkle with sugar.

## Note

If you want to freeze the uncooked logs, it is better to chill them well and cut into slices first. Open freeze until hard then transfer to a bag. You can cook them from frozen — they will take between 18-20 minutes.
