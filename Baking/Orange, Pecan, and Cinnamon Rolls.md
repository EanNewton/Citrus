## Steps

1.  Put the milk in a saucepan and bring up to almost boiling point. Remove from the heat and add the butter. Leave to stand until the butter has melted and it has cooled to blood temperature.
2.  Put the flours in a large bowl with the yeast, sugar and salt. Make a well in the middle. Beat the egg into the milk and butter mixture and stir in the orange zest. Add this to the flour and stir until well combined — you will find that you have a very soft, sticky dough.
3.  Lightly oil your hands and the work surface then turn out the dough. Knead by sliding your fingers under the dough, pulling it up, and slapping it back down onto the work surface. When you move your hands up away from the dough it will come with you — stretch it upwards and to the sides at the same time, then tuck it back under when you repeat the whole motion of lifting it again. After a few minutes you will have a dough that is no longer sticky and can be formed into a smooth ball.
4.  Put the dough into an oiled bowl then cover with plastic wrap or a damp cloth. Leave to rise for around 1 1/2 hours.
5.  While the dough is rising, make the filling. Put the raisins and bourbon in a small saucepan and bring to a boil, then remove from the heat and leave to infuse. Beat the butter with the maple syrup, sugar, spices and salt until you have a creamy, toffee-colored butter.
6.  Preheat the oven to 200 C / 400 F. 
7.  Line a 25 cm round, deep cake tin with baking parchment, and butter generously. Allow the parchment to stand proud of the tin (this will help when removing the cooked buns from the tin).
8.  Turn the risen dough out and roll or pat out into a rectangle of around 30x23 cm / 12x9 inch. It will spring back to start with, but persevere and it will eventually yield. Spread the butter mixture over the dough, then sprinkle with the raisins, pecans and candied zest. Roll up tightly, then cut into 12 rounds.
9.  Arrange the rounds, cut sides up/down, in the prepared cake tin. Brush with the beaten egg, then leave for around another 30 minutes and brush again. Bake in the oven 20-25 minutes until a rich golden brown and well risen.
10.  Meanwhile, melt the marmalade and sugar together with the bourbon or water in a small saucepan. Brush over the buns when they come out of the oven, then remove from the tin en masse by lifting out the baking parchment. Leave to cool.
