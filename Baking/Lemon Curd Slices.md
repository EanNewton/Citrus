## Steps

1.  For the shortbread, put the flour, icing sugar and salt in a bowl or food processor and either rub in or process with the butter until resembling breadcrumbs. Add the milk and egg yolk and bring the dough together into a ball. Flatten out a little, then wrap in plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.
2.  Roll out the chilled dough and use it to line a 30x20cm / 11 3/4 x 8 inch Swiss roll or brownie tin. Chill for a further 15 minutes. Preheat the oven to 180 C / 350 F. 
3.  Prod the shortbread all over with a fork then bake for around 20 minutes until lightly golden.
4.  For the crumble topping, mix the flour, sugar and salt together, then rub in the butter. Lightly mix in the egg yolk â€” this will allow the mixture to clump together a little, which is exactly what you need here. Remove the shortbread from the oven and spread the lemon curd over as evenly as you can. Sprinkle the topping over the lemon curd.
5.  Return to the oven to bake for a further 20 minutes until the crumble topping is golden brown. Cool slightly before you cut into slices.
