## Steps

1.  Preheat the oven to 180 C / 350 F. Butter and line 2 x 20 cm / 8 inch Victoria sandwich tins.
2.  Place 1 tablespoon of the chamomile in a bowl and pour the boiling water over. Leave to steep until cooled. Blitz the remaining chamomile with the sugar and lime zest.
3.  Beat the butter, blitzed sugar and honey together until aerated and fluffy. Whisk the flour and baking powder together in a separate bowl. Gradually incorporate the eggs into the beaten butter and sugar, alternating with tablespoons of flour, then gently fold in the remaining flour. Strain the steeped chamomile and add enough of the liquid to the cake batter to give a dropping consistency.
4.  Divide the batter between the prepared tins. Bake in the oven for around 20-25 minutes until the cakes are springy to touch, a light golden brown, and have started to shrink away from the sides. Leave to cool in the tins for a few minutes then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely.
5.  To make the filling, whisk the cream, honey and lime zest together until stiff enough to pile onto one of the cakes. Spread evenly onto a cooled cake, then add fruit, if you like. Top with the remaining cake, then dust with icing sugar and decorate with chamomile flowers.

## Variation

This is also very good using elderflower in place of the chamomile, in which case you can use either lime or lemon zest. Add a squeeze of citrus juice to the cake batter.
