## Steps

1.  Put the oranges in a saucepan and cover with just-boiled water. Return to a boil and simmer for a couple of hours, until tender — a good way to test this is to see how easily you can break the skin with the handle of a wooden spoon. Alternatively, you can pressure cook the oranges for 30 minutes. Drain the oranges and either run under cold water or wait for them to cool down naturally. As soon as they are cool enough to hold, break them open and remove any seeds. Blitz everything — white membrane, pith and all — in a food processor or blender, until smooth
2.  Preheat the oven to 190 C / 375 F. Butter 21-23 cm loose-bottomed cake tin and line the base with baking parchment.
3.  Break the eggs into a bowl and whisk until frothy, then beat in the sugar, ground pistachios, baking powder and orange blossom water. Stir in the pureed oranges.
4.  Pour the cake batter into the prepared tin. Bake in the oven for 1 hour to 1 hour 20 minutes, depending on the size tin you use (a smaller size will make a deeper cake, which will need a little longer to cook). When the cake is done, a skewer will come out fairly clean.
5.  Leave to cool in the tin for 15 minutes, then turn out onto a cooling rack. Dust with the caster sugar and sprinkle with the nibbed pistachios and rose petals.
6.  Whisk the cream with the icing sugar until it forms soft waves, then stir in the orange blossom water. Serve with slices of the cake.
