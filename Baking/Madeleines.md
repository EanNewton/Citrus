## Steps

1.  Gently melt the butter, then set aside and allow to cool to blood temperature. Whisk the sugar and eggs together in a bowl until well combined and slightly frothy and aerated. Whisk in the remaining ingredients, including the melted butter. Cover and chill in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour, or several if possible — this will help form the traditional "bump" this is so distinctively "madeleine".
2.  When you are almost ready to bake the madeleines, preheat the oven to 180 C / 350 F. Melt a little butter and use it to brush two madeleine tins, then dust with flour and turn upside down and drop onto a surface to remove the excess. Spoon in the madeleine batter — a dessertspoon for each should do it, but make sure you don't over-fill the mould; they should only be around two-thirds full. Bake in the oven for 8-10 minutes until golden brown, slightly darker around the edges and shrunken away slightly from the tin.
3.  Turn out onto a wire rack to cool and try to eat within the hour.
