## Steps

1.  Preheat the oven to 170 C / 340 F. Butter a large loaf tin and line it with baking parchment.
2.  Cream the butter, sugar, and citrus zests together until very pale, fluffy and increased in volume. Add the eggs one at a time, along with 2 tablespoons of the flour, then incorporate the remaining flour. Using a light hand, mix in the mandarin juice — you should have a batter with reluctant dropping consistency.
3.  Scrape into the loaf tin, then bake in the oven for approximately 1 hour — it is done when it has slightly shrunk away from the sides and a skewer comes clean.
4.  While the cake is baking, make the syrup. Put the zests, juices and sugar into a saucepan and warm through gently on a low heat until the sugar has dissolved. Stir in the tequila, if using.
5.  Pierce the cake all over with a cocktail stick or similar, then pour over the syrup, trying to make sure most of it goes into the center of the cake, rather than around the edges. Leave the cake to cool in the tin until it is completely cold.
