## Steps

1.  Preheat the oven to 160 C / 325 F. Butter and line 3 x 20 cm / 8 inch sandwich tins.
2.  To make the meringue, first weigh a large mixing bowl (to ensure an even split of mixture when dividing it between tins). In the bowl, whisk the egg whites to the soft peak stage, then gradually whisk in the sugar. When the meringue is stiff and glossy, add the vinegar and vanilla and whisk again. Stir in the ground hazelnuts.
3.  Weigh the mixture in the bowl and subtract the initial bowl weight from the total -- it's then simple to divide by 3 and spoon an equal amount into each tin.
4.  Smooth down the meringue with a palette knife, making it as even as possible. Bake in the oven for around 25 minutes, until lightly golden brown, then remove from the oven and leave to cool before removing from the tins.
5.  Whisk the cream with the icing sugar until thick enough to spread.
6.  To assemble, spread around 3-4 tablespoons of the cream on top of one of the meringue layers. Drizzle with a couple of tablespoons of curd (this is quite a runny curd) then sprinkle over half the pomegranate seeds. Top and repeat with the second layer, then top with the final meringue. Cover the whole cake -- top and sides -- with the remaining cream. Decorate with a few long strips of pared blood orange zest or even candied zest if you have any, or have the inclination to make some.

## Variations

This can be made with a chocolate ganache in place of the pomegranate seeds. Simply melt together equal quantities of chocolate and heavy cream -- around 100 g each -- and when it has cooled to a spreadable consistency use a palette knife to spread over two of the meringue rounds before topping with the cream and curd.
