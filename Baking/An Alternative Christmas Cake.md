## Steps

1.  Preheat the oven to 170 C / 340 F. Butter and flour a deep Bundt tin. To make sure every bit of the tin is covered, including the central column, put the buttered tin a large bag with the flour and shake it. (Alternatively, you can use a quick-release spray in place of the butter and flour.)
2.  Put the measured flour into a bowl with the baking powder and baking soda and whisk to combine and break up any lumps. Beat the butter and sugar together (preferably in a stand mixer or with an electric hand whisk) until light and very fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time with 2 tbsp of the flour, folding in gently, but thoroughly, then add the rest of the flour.
3.  Add the soured cream and zests. Measure the lemon juice and top up with enough limoncello or other citrus liqueur to 100 ml / 7 tbsp liquid, then add this too. Fold this in with the candied citrus peel and glace cherries. Scrape the mixture into the prepared tin.
4.  Bake in the oven for around 1 hour, but start checking after 45 minutes. The cake will be done when it is springy to the touch and has slightly shrunk away from the sides. Test with a cake tester or skewer if you like — it should be batter-free if the cake is done.
5.  Leave the cake to cool in the tin for at least 10 minutes, then turn out onto a cooling rack — it should fall straight out. Make sure the cake is completely cool before you ice it.
6.  To make the glaze, stir in the limoncello or Mandarine Napoleon into the icing sugar in a bowl, then carefully and gradually add just enough boiling water, starting with just a few drops, to make a consistency that is thick enough to coat the cake, rather than running right off. Drizzle the icing over the cake — covering the top and drizzling pleasingly down the sides.
7.  Decorate as you wish — I sometimes like to use upturned rosemary sprigs, dipped in egg white and then sugar to look frosted, arranged with small figures.
