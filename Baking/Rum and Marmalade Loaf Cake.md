## Steps

1.  Preheat the oven to 180 C / 350 F. Butter and line a 1 kg / 2 pound loaf tin.
2.  Put the raisins in a small saucepan and add the rum. Bring to a boil, then immediately remove from the heat and leave to stand while you make the rest of the cake.
3.  Put the flour in a bowl with the baking powder and spices. Whisk together to combine and remove any lumps.
4.  Beat the butter and sugar together in another bowl with the lime zest until very soft, lightened to the color of butterscotch. Beat in the marmalade, then add the eggs one at a time, adding a couple of tablespoons of the flour mixture with each addition. Stir through the rum-infused raisins along with any liquid that hasn't been absorbed.
5.  Scrape the mixture into the prepared loaf tin and bake in the oven for around 1 hour, until well risen and a rich brown color. For the glaze, melt the marmalade and rum, if using, together in a small saucepan and brush over the cake while it is still warm. Leave to cool in the tin. If you can bear to wrap this up and leave it for a couple of days, it will be all the better for it.
