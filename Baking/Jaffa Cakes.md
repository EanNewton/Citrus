## Steps

1.  First make the jelly as this needs time to set thoroughly. Put the lemon and orange juices into a small pan with the orange and lime zests and the sugar and heat gently, stirring, until the sugar has dissolved. meanwhile, soak the gelatine leaves in cold water until soft. Squeeze out the and add to the liquid, stirring until they have completely dissolved. Line a small roasting tin with plastic wrap and pour the liquid into it. Leave to cool to room temperature then refrigerate for several hours until completely set.
2.  To make the sponge base, preheat the oven to 180 C / 350 F. Lightly butter 2 x 12-hole muffin tins, or spray with cooking oil. Put the eggs and sugar in a bowl and beat with an electric whisk for several minutes until increased in volume, mousse-like and the color of pale apricot. Sift the flour into the mixture and fold in, then add the melted butter. Spoon the mixture into the muffin tin — each should take a tablespoon. Bake in the oven for 8-10 minutes until lightly golden brown.
3.  Leave to cool for a few minutes then remove from the tin — they should just flip straight out, but if not, prise them out gently with a palette knife. When they are completely cool, cut the set jelly into 4 cm / 1 1/2 inch rounds (use a small shot glass if you don't have a cutter that size) and place on top, as centrally as you can. Melt the chocolate in a bain marie or heatproof bowl set over a pan of simmering water, then use it to completely coat the tops of the cakes. You will find that you need a heaped teaspoon per cake. Make sure that the chocolate isn't too hot when you start or the jelly might melt or sweat a little. Leave the chocolate to set somewhere cool before eating, then dust with powdered orange zest, mixed with edible gold powder if you have some.
