## Steps

1.  Blanch the sprouts in plenty of boiling, salted water for 2 minutes, then drain. Heat the olive oil in a lidded frying pan and add the sprouts. Cover and cook over a medium heat, shaking the pan regularly, for 4-5 minutes, until starting brown. Mix the chipotle with a little water and add to the pan with the garlic. Toss to coat the sprouts in the chilli, then sprinkle over the lime zest and juice along with a generous amount of salt and pepper and the nigella seeds. Cook for a further couple of minutes, then remove from the heat.
