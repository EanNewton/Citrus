## Steps

1.  Take 2 large cucumbers, then peel, halve lengthways, deseed and roughly chop. Heat 1 tbsp oil in a wok. Lightly crush 1 tsp each of Szechuan peppercorns and coriander seeds and add to the wok along with 1 finely sliced chilli, a 1 cm / 3/8 inch piece of root ginger, finely chopped, and 1 scant tsp finely grated orange zest. Stir fry for a minute, then add the cucumber along with the juice of 2 oranges. Season with salt and pepper (or simply add a dash of say sauce), then leave to simmer for a few minutes until the orange juice has reduced to a very light syrup.
