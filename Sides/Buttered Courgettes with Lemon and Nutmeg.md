## Steps

1.  Take 500 g / 1 lb 2 oz small, firm courgettes (zucchini) - the sort that haven't swelled from an excess of watering. Melt 30 g butter in a large, lidded frying pan and add the zucchini with the finely grated zest of 1 lemon and a generous amount of seasoning. Add a splash of water, then cover and braise gently for 5 minutes, stirring every so often. Remove the lid -- if there seems as though there is a lot of water in the pan (there may be if you are using large courgettes), simmer until it has reduced. Add a fine rasp of nutmeg and a squeeze of lemon juice, then stir in a handful of basil just before serving.
