## Steps

1.  Preheat the oven to 200 C / 400 F. Scrub 1 kg/ 2 lb 3 oz new potatoes and cut in half if particularly large. Thickly slice 1 onion. Whisk 100 g / 1/3 cup wholegrain Dijon mustard with 3 tbsp olive oil, the finely grated zest and juice of 1 lemon and plenty of salt and pepper. Toss the potatoes in this mix. Sprinkle the onion over the base of a large roasting tin then top with the potatoes. Sprinkle over lots of freshly cut rosemary. Roast in the oven, turning everything over a couple of times, for around 45-50 minutes, until the potatoes are crisp, and tender inside.
