## Steps

1.  First make the yuzu butter. Beat the yuzu powder and juice, the garlic powder and 1/2 tsp sea salt into the butter until it is well mixed. Scoop into a container and refrigerate until you need it.
2.  Preheat the oven to 200 C / 400 F. Prick the sweet potatoes all over with a fork or knife tip, then rub with olive oil. Sprinkle with salt.
3.  Place the sweet potatoes on a baking tray and cook for around an hour, less if they are particularly small. Slice the top down the middle, lengthways, and wait for the steam to subside. Put around a tablespoon of the butter into each cut, and serve.
