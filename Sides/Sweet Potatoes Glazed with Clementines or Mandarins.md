## Steps

1.  Put the garlic, clementine or mandarin zest and juice and half the lime juice into a wide saucepan or frying pan. Add the sugar or honey and cook on a low heat, stirring until the sugar or honey has dissolved. Bring to a boil and cook down until the mixture is very lightly syrupy â€” you don't want it too dense. Remove from the heat and season with salt.
2.  Meanwhile, toss the sweet potatoes in the remaining lime juice and season with salt. Steam over boiling water for 6-7 minutes. Transfer to the frying pan and very gently turn over in the syrup. Garnish with the red chilli and the chives.
