## Steps

1.  Take around 500 g / 4 cups baby broad (fava) beans — when small they don't really need their skins removed. If you are using larger beans, increase the amount to 600 g / 4 3/4 cups and skin them. Slice 1 shallot very finely and saute in 1 tbsp olive oil and 10 g butter. Add the beans with the finely grated zest of 1 lemon, plenty of seasoning and a splash of water. Cover and braise for 4-5 minutes until tender. Taste and squeeze in plenty of lemon juice, then stir in lots of freshly cut dill.
