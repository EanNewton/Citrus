## Steps

1.  This includes finely grated zest and I use it mainly with Caribbean style dishes — but if you want to make it more Thai, you can add a braised lemongrass stem and just 1 small kaffir lime leaf as well. Rinse 300 g / 1 3/4 cup rice as for [Gently Scented Rice](https://github.com/EanNewton/Citrus/blob/master/Sides/Gently%20Scented%20Rice.md), and put in a saucepan. Season and add the finely grated zest and juice of 1 lime. Sprinkle over 50 g powdered coconut milk (the sort you usually rehydrate before use, no coconut flour) and add 450 ml / 1 3/4 cup boiling water. Cook as for the Gently Scented Rice, making sure you remove from the heat and leave to steam for at least 10 minutes at the end. Garnish with cilantro and some freshly shaved coconut if you like. I will sometimes add 200 g / 1 cup cooked black beans to this as well, although the color will obviously suffer for it. This is very good with Mojo Chicken (see: ).
