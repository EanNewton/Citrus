## Steps

1.  Put a few pieces of dried bitter orange peel in a saucepan and cover with water. Bring to a oil and simmer for 5 minutes, then drain and rinse. Repeat this twice more. Follow the instructions for Gently Scented Rice (see: ), adding any aromatics you like -- I will usually include a bay leaf, a few cardamom pods, a small piece of cinnamon, a few peppercorns and coriander seeds. Rinse 500 g / 3 cup basmati rice as before. Fry the spices and orange peel in 1 tbsp oil, then add the rice. For an even sweeter touch, add 50 g finely chopped dates as well. Stir to coat, then pour in 750 ml / 3 cup freshly boiled water. Cook as before -- after 15 minutes, push holes in the rice with a wooden spoon handle, top with slices of butter and sprinkle with a few drops of orange blossom water. Leave to stand, covered, for another 10 minutes.
