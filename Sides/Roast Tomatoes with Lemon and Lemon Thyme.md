## Steps

1.  Take 400 g / 14 oz small to medium (i.e. slightly larger than cherry) vine tomatoes. Separate them from the vine but leave the core leaves. Heat a heavy-based frying pan to as hot as you can get it. Add 1 tbsp olive oil and the tomatoes. Cook, shaking regularly, until the tomatoes are threatening --but not quite ready -- to burst out of their skins. This won't take long. Cut the peel off a large lemon and dice the flesh, taking out any pips as you go. Add this into the pan -- it should sizzle and start caramelizing almost immediately. Shake a couple of times and remove. Serve sprinkled with salt and lemon thyme, and perhaps some shredded basil if you like. Capers are also a good addition here: you can add them just before the lemons so they can sizzle for a moment on their own first.
