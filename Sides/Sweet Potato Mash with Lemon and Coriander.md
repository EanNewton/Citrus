## Steps

1.  There are several ways to cook sweet potatoes before mashing them. The quickest method -- boiling -- is not the best as it can waterlog delicate sweet potatoes. So either peel and cut into chunks then steam for 7-8 minutes (2 minutes in a pressure cooker) or -- and this is my preferred method when I am not short of time -- pierce the skins all over with a fork and bake in a 200 C / 400 F oven for 45 minutes to 1 hour. Cut open, let all the steam escape, then scrape out the flesh. 
2.  Whichever method you use, mash the flesh with the butter and the remaining ingredients, along with plenty of salt.
