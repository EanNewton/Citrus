## Steps

1.  For this fragrant, mellow dish, use pared lemon or lime zest, or leaves -- anything else will be too bitter. Rinse 300 g / 1 3/4 cup of your choice of rice -- basmati or jasmine work best -- under plenty of cold water until it is running clear. Drain thoroughly and add to a saucepan with a generous pinch of salt and either a few pieces of pared lemon, lime or mandarin zest or a handful of citrus leaves. Add any other aromatics you like, then add 450 ml / 1 3/4 cup freshly boiled water, or a light stock. Return to a boil, then turn down and cover, putting a tea towel or a few sheets of kitchen paper between the pot and its lid. Simmer until all the liquid has been absorbed, around 15 minutes, then remove from the heat and leave to steam for a further 510 minutes. you should have perfectly dry, fluffy, aromatic rice.
