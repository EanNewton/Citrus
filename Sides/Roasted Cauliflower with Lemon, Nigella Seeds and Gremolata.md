## Steps

1.  Preheat the oven to 200 C / 400 F. Break a large cauliflower into florets and cut the larger florets in half lengthways. Break up a head of garlic and leave the cloves unpeeled. Add both to a roasting tin.  Mix together 1 tbsp olive oil with the juice of 1 lemon or lime (finely grated zest before juicing, and reserve). Add salt, 1 tsp nigella seeds, 1/2 tsp cumin seeds and 1/2 tsp dried chilli flakes, or you can use a finely chopped fresh chilli instead if you prefer. Pour this over the cauliflower and garlic, turn to coat then spread out into an even layer. Roast for around 35-40 minutes until the cauliflower is nicely charred and al dente.
2.  To make the gremolata, finely chop 2 garlic cloves and a small bunch of cilantro. Mix together with the reserved lemon or lime zest and season with salt. This can also be turned into a type of dressing with more olive oil and citrus juice if you prefer. Serve separately at the table.
