## Ingredients

* 1 kg / 2 lb 3 oz small new potatoes, scrubbed but unpeeled
* 100 g caster (superfine) sugar
* 75 g butter
* Finely grated zest of 1/2 sour orange and juice of 2 sour oranges (or zest of 1/2 orange and 1/2 lime, juice of 1 orange and 1 lime)
* Salt

## Steps

1.  Put the potatoes in a saucepan and cover with water. Bring to a boil and add salt. Simmer until knife-tender, around 12-15 minutes. Drain and cool under running water, then peel them, if you like -- you should find that the skins slip off very easily.
2.  Melt the sugar in a large, heavy-based frying pan over a medium heat. Leave it alone, perhaps just giving it a shake every so often, until it has caramelized -- it will start around the edges and eventually turn a light golden brown. Add the butter (be careful, it may splutter) and allow it to melt into the caramel, keeping the stirring to minimum. Whisk in the zest, juice and pinch of salt. Add the potatoes then leave to cook, slowly, and turning regularly, until the caramel has reduced down and the potatoes are well coated.
