## Steps

1.  Heat the olive oil in a large frying pan. Melt the honey in a small saucepan then brush over the cut edges of the chicory (endive). Sear the chicory in the frying pan, cut side down, until it has started to caramelize, then flip over and cook for a couple more minutes. Add the butter, citrus zests and juices and the soy sauce, pouring them around the chicory, then sprinkle in the thyme sprigs and season with salt and pepper. Simmer, turning regularly, until the chicory is glossy and tender, and the liquids have reduced to a syrup.
