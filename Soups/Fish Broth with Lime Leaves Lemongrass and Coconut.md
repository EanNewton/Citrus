## Steps

1.  First marinate the fish. Put in a bowl and season generously with salt and pepper. Mix the lime zest and juice with the garlic and chilli, then dilute with 100 ml / 7 tbsp water. Pour this over the fish and leave to stand for around 30 minutes.
2.  Meanwhile, make the paste. Put all the ingredients in a small food processor with some salt and pepper, and blend until fairly smooth.
3.  Put the stock, coconut milk, and fish sauce or soy in a large saucepan or flameproof casserole. Add the thyme, lime leaves and all but a tablespoon of the paste. Bring to a boil and simmer gently for 2 minutes, then add the aubergine and red bell pepper. Simmer until almost tender, around 10 minutes, then add the greens. When they have wilted down, drain the fish, pat it dry and add to the broth. Simmer for a couple of minutes.
4.  Serve over a small amount of rice or noodles, sprinkled with basil leaves and with a squeeze of lime.
