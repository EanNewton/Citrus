## Steps

1.  Heat the olive oil and butter in a large saucepan or flameproof casserole. When the butter has melted, add the leeks with a splash of water and season with salt and pepper. Cover and cook very gently for 10 minutes, checking every so often until tender and buttery. Add the garlic and cook for a further couple of minutes, trying not to stir too much.
2.  Add the zest, chard leaves and beans, then pour over the stock. Bring to the boil then reduce the heat and simmer for a few minutes until the beans are tender, then add the couscous and chicken. Continue to simmer just to warm through.
3.  While the soup is simmering, make the harissa dressing. Simply put everything in a food processor and blitz until you have a fresh-looking green paste -- you may have to thin with a little water if you are finding it recalcitrant. Taste for seasoning and add salt if necessary.
4.  Serve the soup with spoonfuls of the dressing stirred in at the last minute, with a few shavings of Parmesan, if you like.
