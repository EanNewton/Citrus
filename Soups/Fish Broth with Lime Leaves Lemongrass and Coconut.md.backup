## Steps

1.  Put the chicken breasts in a bowl. Mix together the marinade ingredients and pour this over the chicken. Leave to marinate for 1 hour. Heat a griddle pan until it is too hot to hold your hand over. Griddle the chicken for 3-4 minutes on each side until just cooked through. Set aside.
2.  Heat the oil for the soup in a large flameproof casserole or saucepan. Add the onion, red peppers, and celergy. Saute on a low heat until translucent and starting to brown lightly. This will take at least 10-15 minutes. 
3.  Meanwhile, put the tomatoes, unpeeled garlic cloves and chilli in a heavy-based frying pan and dry roast for a similar amount of time until the tomatoes are blackening. If the chilli and garlic look done before the tomatoes, fish them out and put to one side. Peel the garlic cloves and put in a food processor with the unpeeled tomatoes and chilli. Blitz until smooth.
4.  Add the coriander stems and thyme sprig to the onion pan and cook for a couple of minutes. Pour in the tomato mixture and simmer for 5 minutes until starting to reduce. Add the chicken stock and continue to simmer for aroudn 15-20 minutes.
5.  For the garnishes, dice the avocado and toss in the lime juice.
