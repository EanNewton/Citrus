## Ingredients

* 1 kg / 2 lb 3 oz new, salad, or waxy potatoes, preferably quite small, scrubbed but unpeeled
* 30 g flaky sea salt (Maldon is good, as is the smoked version for a slightly different flavor)
* Finely grated zest of 2 lemons
* 1 tsp herbes de Provence
* 1/2 tsp black peppercorns, freshly ground or crushed
* 1 litre / 4 cups water

### For the aioli
* A large pinch of saffron strands
* 1 tbsp warm water
* 3 garlic cloves, crushed
* 2 egg yolks
* 1/2 tsp Dijon mustard
* Pinch of salt
* 300 ml / 1 1/4 cup sunflower oil
* Juice of 1/2 lemon

## Steps

1.  Put the potatoes in a large, heavy-based frying pan (I use one with straight, fairly deep sides), making sure they fit in a single layer. Mix the salt with the zest, herbes de Provence, and pepper. Add to the potatoes with the water.
2.  Bring the water to the boil and, rather than turn down to simmer, keep boiling until the liquid has evaporated. When all the water has disappeared, turn the heat down low and cook for a few minutes, giving the pan a shake every so often to roll the potatoes over, until they are completely dry and wrinkly with a light coating of flavoured salt.
3.  While they are cooking, make the aioli. Using a pestle and mortar, grind the saffron strands to a powder, spoon the warm water over and set aside to soak. Fold up a tea towel and place it under a bowl — this will keep the bowl steady when you need to whisk and pour at the same time.
4.  Put the crushed garlic in the bowl with the egg yolks, mustard and saffron-infused water. Add the salt, then whisk, until completely combined. Start drizzling in the oil, a drop at a time and whisking all the time until you are confident the mixture has emulsified, then you can add it at a slightly faster rate. Continue until all the oil has been incorporated, then add the lemon juice. Give a final whisk — it will look liquid for a minute but will soon settle back into a thick creamy mayonnaise.
5.  Serve the potatoes hot from the pan. They should be the perfect combination of zesty, salty crust and sweet flesh; perfect with the aioli.
