## Steps

1.  Put the prawns in a bowl. Using a pestle and mortar, grind together the salt, white pepper, and yuzu zest, if using, and sprinkle the mixture over the prawns. Divide the lettuce between 4 serving bowls or glasses.
2.  Whisk all the dressing ingredients together, with some salt and pepper. Taste and adjust the flavours accordingly. Add the prawns to the lettuce leaves and top with some of the dressing. Garnish with a little more yuzu powder and a few snips of dill, if you like.
