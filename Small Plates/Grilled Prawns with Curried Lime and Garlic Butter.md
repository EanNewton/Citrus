## Steps

1.  Heat a large griddle pan or barbecue. Melt the butter with the lime zest, garlic, chilli, curry powder, and thyme, then season with plenty of salt and pepper. Flatten out the prawns and brush with a little of the flavoured butter, then grill cut side down for a couple of minutes. Turn over and brush with more of the butter mixture and grill for a further 2 minutes.
2.  Remove to a plate and add the limes to the griddle or barbecue. Cook for around 30 seconds on each cut side to caramelize and char slightly.
3.  Serve with the rest of the flavoured butter for dipping, the lime wedges for squeezing.
