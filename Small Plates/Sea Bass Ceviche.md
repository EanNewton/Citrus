## Steps

1.  Segment the oranges, working over a bowl to catch any juice, cut each segment in half and set aside. Squeeze out the peel and membranes into the juice.
2.  Next make the tiger's milk. Put the ginger and garlic in a small bowl with the coriander stems, lime juice, chilli, and thyme. Add the reserved juice and leave for 5 minutes to infuse. Strain, then add a generous pinch of salt.
3.  Put some iced water in a small bowl with a teaspoon of salt added. Add the red onion and leave to soak for 5 minutes. Drain and dry.
4.  To prepare the sea bass, place it skin side down, then cut into slices diagonally across the grain so you end up with fairly flat, skinless slices, similar to the way you would cut smoked salmon. Cut these in half. Alternatively, you can simply cut into thick strips, but I think the slices look prettier on the plate. Put in a bowl, sprinkle with a generous pinch of salt, and mix. After 2 minutes, add the tiger's milk and leave for a further 2 minutes only (it will carry on "cooking" after being removed).
5.  Remove the sea bass from its marinade and arrange flat on a plate. Add the red onion slices, orange segments, and tomatoes, then sprinkle with the cilantro and basil. Serve immediately, with shots of the leftover marinade on the side if you like.
