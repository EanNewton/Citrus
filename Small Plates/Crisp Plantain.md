# Crisp Plantain


---

## Ingredients

* Juice of 1 lime
* 2 large, green plantain
* Vegetable oil, for deep frying

---

## Steps

1.  Put some cold water in a medium bowl and add the lime juice.
2.  Peel (or in practice cut through and break off) the skin from the plantain. Cut into 2 cm / 3/4 inch diagonal slices and drop into the water as you go.
3.  Heat enough oil for deep-frying in a large, heavy-based pan or frying, to about 160 C / 320 F. Drain the plantain, then par-fry them in the oil for around 3 minutes, until very lightly coloured and slightly softened.
4.  Remove the plantain to kitchen paper then squash each slice flat under something heavy, such as a heavy-based frying pan; they should be around 0.5 cm / 1/4 inch thick with a much larger surface area.
5.  Reheat the oil to around 180 C / 350 F. Dip each plantain slice into the limed water, shake off the excess (but don't pat dry; they should be slightly wet) and drop into the hot oil. Fry until they are a rich golden brown, then remove with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper.
