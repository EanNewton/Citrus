## Steps

1.  Heat a griddle pan until it is too hot to hold your hand near. Toss the halloumi in the ouzo and oregano. Brush the leaves lightly with olive oil then wrap each piece of halloumi in a leaf, securing with a toothpick.
2.  Put the halloumi on the griddle or bbq and cook for 2 minutes on each side until the leaves are starting to burn and the halloumi has softened.
3.  Unwrap, leaving the halloumi on the leaves, and drizzle with a little more olive oil. Serve with lemon wedges.
