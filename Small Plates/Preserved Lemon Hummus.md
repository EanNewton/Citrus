## Steps

1.  Put the drained chickpeas in a blender with half the lemon juice, the garlic, and the tahini and a little of the reserved liquid. Blitz, pushing down regularly, adding a little more liquid if necessary. Season with salt and taste. Add mroe garlic and lemon juice if you like, and blitz again. You should end up with a soft consistency, but it should hold its shape.
2.  To serve, transfer to a bowl and drizzle with olive oil. Cut the preserved lemon into a fine dice, and sprinkle centrally over the hummus. Sprinkle with sumac or paprika.
