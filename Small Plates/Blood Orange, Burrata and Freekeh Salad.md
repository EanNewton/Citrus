## Steps

1.  First cook the freekeh. Soak it in plenty of cold water for 5 minutes, then drain and rinse thoroughly. Put in a medium saucepan with the stock, garlic, and zest. Season with salt, thing bring to a boil and leave to simmer for 15-20 minutes until cooked — it should be plumped up but still with some bite. Add the bergamot juice and leave to stand for a few minutes before straining.
2.  Heat the olive oil in a large frying pan. Add the onion wedges and saute over a medium heat until starting to turn translucent — you want them softened but not completely collapsed. Add the chard, along with the water, and cook over a gentle heat until the chard has wilted down and the stems are still al dente. Season with salt and pepper.
3.  Arrange the freekeh over a large platter and top with the onions and chard. Pour over any reserved juice from the blood oranges — there should be a fair bit. Break up the burrata over the salad, then top with the orange slices and mint leaves. Drizzle over a little olive oil.
