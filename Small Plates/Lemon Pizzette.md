## Steps

1.  To make the dough, mix the flour and yeast together in a large bowl, then add the salt. Gradually add the water and olive oil until you have a dough, then turn out onto a floured surface and knead until the dough is soft, smooth, and elastic. (Alternatively, put the whole lot in a stand mixer and knead with the dough hook.) Return to the bowl, cover with a damp tea towel or plastic wrap and leave until it has doubled in size.
2.  For small pizzette (around around 20 cm / 8 inch diameter) divide the dough into 12 balls. For larger, 30 cm / 12 inch pizzette, divide into 8. (Freeze any dough you are not using at this stage.)
3.  Preheat your oven to its highest temperature. Preheat a pizza stone or baking tray.
4.  Roll out each piece of dough to the desired size, pulling it out until it stops springing back. Add some shredded mozzarella. Blanch the lemon slices (allowing for a couple per pizzette) in boiling water for 1 minute, then drain and cut into quarters. Arrange over the mozzarella, then crumble over the fennel sausages. Sprinkle over a few chilli flakes and basil leaves, then drizzle with olive oil.
5.  Transfer the pizzette to the preheated stone or baking trays, working in batches if necessary, and bake for 6-8 minutes. Serve immediately, sprinkled with extra basil leaves.
