## Steps

1.  In a small bowl, mix together the salt, sugar, allspice, peppercorns, and lime zest. Sprinkle half of this over the base of a dish large enough to hold the fish. Drizzle the tequila or rum over both sides of the fish, then place on top of the salt and spice mixture. Sprinkle over the remaining salt and spice mix. Cover with plastic wrap and leave to cure in the refrigerator for around 6 hours, then rinse thoroughly and pat dry â€” dont worry, you will not be rinsing off the flavour with the salt; it will have impregnated the flesh. Slice into thin slices at an angle.
2.  For the salsa, mix all the ingredients together in a bowl with a very little salt (the fish will be quite salty) and some pepper.
3.  To serve, pile the fish onto the plantain or tostadas and top with the salsa.
