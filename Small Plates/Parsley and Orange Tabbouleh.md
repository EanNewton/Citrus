## Steps

1.  Segment the oranges over a bowl to catch any juice, cut into dice and set aside. Squeeze out the peel and membranes into the juice.
2.  Rinse the bulgar wheat in plenty of cold water. Drain thoroughly and put in a bowl. Add the onion, tomatoes, cucumber, herbs and diced orange, and season with salt.
3.  Add the reserved juice to all the dressing ingredients and season with salt and pepper. Whisk together. Pour this over the salad just before you are about to eat and toss lightly.
