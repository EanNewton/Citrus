## Steps

1.  Segment the oranges or mandarins over a bowl to catch any juice, and set the segments aside. Squeeze out the peel and membranes into the juice.
2.  Make sure the tuna is extremely well chilled — in fact, it does no harm to freeze it for an hour before you want to use it, and makes it easier to cut. Cut into an even dice, around 1.5-2 cm / 1/2-3/4 inch place in a dish and sprinkle with salt. Whisk together all the dressing ingredients and pour over the tuna. Leave to marinate in the refrigerator for 30-60 minutes, no longer.
3.  When you are ready to serve, put the tuna and its dressing in a serving bowl with the orange or mandarin segments, beets, avocado, and srping onions. Mix the reserved juice with the lime juice and pour over the contents of the bowl. Fold very gnetly - you don't want the beetroot to bleed too much or for the avocado to turn to mush.
4.  Serve with rice or quinoa, or simply pile into lettuce leaves, sprinkled with sesame seeds and coriander leaves.
