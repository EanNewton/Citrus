## Ingredients

* Juice of 1/2 lemon
* A large bunch of fairly mature Swiss chard, stripped of leaves and stems and cut into 10 cm / 4 inch lengths
* 1 tbsp olive oil
* Salt and pepper

### For the sauce
* 100 g butter
* 50g / 2oz tin of anchovies in olive oil
* Finely grated zest and juice of 1 lemon
* 2 garlic cloves, crushed
* 1/2 tsp dried chilli flakes, optional

## Steps

1.  Add the lemon juice to a bowl of water. Drop the chard stems into the acidulated water to stop them from going brown.
2.  Heat a griddle pan to a medium heat â€” you don't want it as hot as you would for meat. Drain the chard stems, shake off any excess water and rub with the oil. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and place on the griddle. Grill on both sides until softened, with distinctive char lines.
3.  Meanwhile, make the sauce. Pu the butter and anchovies, including their oil, in a small saucepan. Set over a low heat and when the butter has melted set to work on the anchovies, mashing them into the butter and oil. Add the lemon zest and juice, garlic and chilli flakes, if using. Taste (as the anchovies are salty) and add seasoning if you think it needs it. Give it a good whisk just to stop any separation in its tracks. Serve the chard with the sauce in a bowl on the side. Use your fingers and dip the chard, or be more decorous and pour the sauce over, to be eaten with a fork and knife.
