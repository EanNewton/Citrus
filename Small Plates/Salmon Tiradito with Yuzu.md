## Steps

1.  First make the dressing. Put all the ingredients into a small food processor and blitz until fairly smooth. It is up to you whether you strain it or not — I quite like it green-flecked. Taste and adjust the salt, sugar, and citrus juice if you feel the balance is not quite right — some limes are sweeter / less acidic than others.
2.  Cut the spring onion greens into 6 cm / 2 1/2 inch lengths. Cut down one side to open up, then shred lengthways. Put into a bowl of iced water until they curl up — it will take at least 30 minutes. Drain thoroughly.
3.  Cut the salmon into slices similar to the cut of smoked salmon — so as finely as you can across the grain into thin slices that span the width of the fish. Arrange over 4 serving plates and sprinkle over the cucumber, cress, dill and spring onion curls. Drizzle over the dressing and sprinkle with sesame seeds.
