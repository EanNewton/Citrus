## Steps

1.  If you want to split the wings into flats and drummettes, you can do so, otherwise leave them in their natural heart shape. Put into a bowl and season with salt and pepper. Put all the marinade ingredients into a food processor and blend together until smooth. Pour over the chicken wings and stir to combine — give a massage with your hands if you can bear to; it will make a difference. Leave for at least an hour, but up to overnight (refrigerated) if possible.
2.  When you are ready to cook, either prepare a barbecue or preheat the oven to 200 C / 400 F.
3.  For the glaze, put the grapefruit juice into a small saucepan over a hight heat and reduce by half. Add the butter and honey. When melted, whisk in the zest, chilli powder, soy sauce, and rum. Drain the chicken wings and pat dry. Either grill over indirect heat, turning reularly and basting with the glaze, or spread them out on baking tray, brush with the glaze and bake in the oven for around 45-50 minutes, turning and basting with the glaze regularly, until a rich dark brown with crisp, slightly sticky skin.
4.  Meanwhile, ctu the spring oinon greens into lengths and cut down one side to open up, then shred lengthways. Put into a bowl of iced water they curl up pleasingly — it will take at least half an hour. Drain thoroughly.
5.  To serve, sprinkle the spring oinon greens over the wings with sesame seeds, if you like.
