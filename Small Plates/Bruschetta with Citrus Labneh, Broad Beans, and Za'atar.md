## Steps

1.  To make the labneh, mix the yogurt with the salt in a bowl. Line a sieve or colander with a double layer of muslin or cheesecloth. Place the yoghurt in the muslin, bring up the sides of the cloth and tie them together. Either suspend the cloth from a wooden spoon or leave in a large colander, both placed over a bowl to catch any liquid. Leave in the refrigerator overnight, then transfer the labneh to a bowl and stir in the zests and herbs.
2.  To assemble, toast the bread and drizzle with olive oil. Slather some of the labneh quite thickly onto the bread. Sprinkle with the broad (fava) beans, za'atar and sumac, then drizzle over the preserved lemon liquid, if using, and more olive oil.
