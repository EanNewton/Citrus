## Steps

1.  First make the hollandaise. Fold up a tea towel and place it under a bowl -- this will keep the bowl steady when you need to whisk and pour at the same time.
2.  Put the egg yolks in a bowl and add the orange zest with a pinch of salt. Whisk lighlty using a balloon whisk. Put most of the orange juice into a small saucepan, reserving a little, and bring to a boil. Remove from the heat, then pour over the egg yolks in a slow, steady stream, whisking as you go. Keep whisking until foamy.
3.  When you have incorporated all the juice, start adding the butter, very gradually and whisking constantly. When the butter has been incorporated you should have a rich, frothy hollandaise. Stir in the reserved orange juice. Keep warm -- either by covering the bowl and leaving it over a pan of hot water, or simply transferring to a thermos flask.
4.  Put the hazelnuts in a frying pan and toast over a medium heat, shaking regularly, until aromatic and nutty. Remove from the heat and crush lightly so they break apart.
5.  Blanch the purple sprouting broccoli in boiling water for 2-3 minutes, then drain thoroughly and season with salt.
6.  Meanwhile, heat a griddle pan until very hot. Griddle the sprouting broccoli for a couple of minutes on each side, then pile onto a large platter. Sprinkle with the hazelnuts and either serve with the hollandaise in bowls for dipping, or drizzle it over -- how you serve it depends very much on whether or not you want to use your fingers.
