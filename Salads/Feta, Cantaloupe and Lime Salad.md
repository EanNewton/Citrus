## Steps

1.  Quarter the melon, peel and deseed, then cut into chunks and put into a bowl. Peel the cucumber, cut in half lengthways and scrape out the seeds with a teaspoon. Slice each half into chunky crescents, about 0.5 cm / 1/4 inch thick, and add to the melon. Cut the skin away from the lime and slice into thin rounds, then add to the bowl.
2.  Make the dressing by whisking all the ingredients together and seasoning with salt and pepper. Drizzle most of the dressing over the melon, cucumber, and lime salad, and toss well.
3.  Arrange the salad over serving plates and add the feta. Sprinkle over some mint leaves and top with more dressing.
