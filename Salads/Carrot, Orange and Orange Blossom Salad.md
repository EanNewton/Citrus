## Steps

1.  Peel and julienne around 400 g carrots — they need to be a shape and size similar to matchsticks. Add 50 g pistachio nibs or crush or chop some regular pistachios. Mix 2 tbsp olive oil with 2 tsp lemon juice and the juice of 1 orange. Add a few drops of orange blossom water, then season and whisk until well combined. Pour over the carrots and pistachios, then mix. Garnish with some freshly chopped parsley or mint.
