## Steps

1.  In a large bowl, whisk together the olive oil, lemon zest and juice, ouzo (if using), sugar, and chilli powder or paste. Add salt and pepper to taste.
2.  Bring a large saucepan of salted water to a boil. When it is nicely rolling, add all the squid and garlic and boil for precisely 40 seconds. Drain and immediately add to the prepared marinade.
3.  Leave the squid to marinate for at least an hour, then mix with the new potatoes, if using, fennel and lemon. Add the chillies, parsley,, basil, and oregano and toss everything gently together. Serve at room temperature.
