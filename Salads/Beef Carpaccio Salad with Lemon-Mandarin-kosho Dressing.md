## Steps

1.  First prepare the beef for slicing. Wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and put in the freezer for at least 30 minutes, preferably a little longer (up to an hour), to firm it up.
2.  Meanwhile, make the dressings. For the carpaccio dressing, put the egg yolks, kosho, and juices in a bowl and whisk together with the sugar. Gradually drizzle in the oil, initially a few drops at a time, until you have a fairly thin emulsion. You may not need to use all the oil. Taste for seasoning and add salt, pepper, or more sugar if you think it needs it. Set aside.
3.  Whisk together the salad dressing ingredients and season with salt and pepper. Set to one side.
4.  Prepare the beef. Remove the plastic wrap, then using your sharpest knife, slice as thinly as you can. Arrange over 4 serving plates and drizzle with the carpaccio dressing, making sure you reserve some of it.
5.  Put all the salad leaves in a bowl and drizzle over the salad dressing. Mix then put a small pile of leaves on top of the carpaccio, then add the radish and orange. Sprinkle with sesame seeds.
