## Steps

1.  Heat the olive oil in a frying pan and add the lamb with a splash of water, just to warm it through and to melt any fat that might be clinging to it. Drain on some kitchen paper.
2.  In a bowl, toss the artichokes with the preserved lemon. Arrange the lamb's lettuce over a platter and top with the lamb and artichokes. Sprinkle over the chopped dates.
3.  Using a pestle and mortar, finely grind the saffron threads with a pinch of salt, then dissolve in the hot water and honey. Whisk into the yogurt with the garlic, lemon juice, and olive oil. Taste for seasoning and add more salt if necessary. 
4.  Drizzle the bright yellow dressing over the salad, then top with the mint leaves.
