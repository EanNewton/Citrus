## Steps

1.  Take a large punnet of sweet cherry tomatoes and cut each in half. Arrange over a plate and season with salt. Heat 1 tbsp olive oil in a frying pan. Segment 1 large lemon, dice and strain, reserving the juice for something else. Add the lemon to the hot oil, along with 1 tbsp capers. It should spit and sizzle. Toss a couple of times, then pour the lot over the tomatoes. Sprinkle with a few thyme leaves.
