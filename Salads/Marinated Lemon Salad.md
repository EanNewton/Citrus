## Steps

1.  Cut the pith and skin off 3-4 lemons, depending on the size, then slice into rounds, flicking out the pips as you go. Arrange over a plate and sprinkle with a few sprigs of rosemary. Season with salt then drizzle over some olive oil. Leave to stand at room temperature for a few hours if possible. Lightly toast 2 tbsp flaked almonds in a frying pan. Sprinkle these over the lemons and serve.
