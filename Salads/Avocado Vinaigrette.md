1.  Gently heat 2 tbsp olive oil. Add 2 tsp [lime-Scotch-bonnet-kosho](https://github.com/EanNewton/Citrus/blob/master/Preserves/Lime-Scotch%20Bonnet%20Kosho.md) along with 1 garlic clove and 1 small piece of fresh root ginger, both finely chopped, and 1 tbsp finely chopped coriander stems. Remove from the heat, add the juice of 1/2 a lime and season with salt and pepper. Cut an avocado in half, remove the stone and peel. Slice each half into lengths and fan over a plate. Segment 1 orange and dice the flesh. Sprinkle this over the avocado. Top with 2 finely chopped spring onion, then cover with the dressing.
