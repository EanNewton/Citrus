## Steps

1.  First prepare the chicken. Heat the coconut oil in a large, shallow pan and add the chicken, skin side down. Fry on a medium to high heat until the skin is crisp and brown, then turn over. Add the garlic, ginger and lemongrass, then pour the coconut milk around the chicken. Add the lime zest and juice, the lime leaves (if using), and the peppercorns, and season with the fish sauce and some salt. Reduce the heat and leave to simmer, uncovered, so the sauce reduces, until the chicken is cooked through, around 15 minutes. Remove the chicken. Strain the sauce and reserve.
2.  To assemble the salad, heat the vegetable oil in a small pan and fry the shallots quite briskly until they are translucent and well browned. Remove to drain on some kitchen paper and set aside. Arrange the raw vegetables over a large plate or platter. Slice or shred the chicken, skin included, and add to the vegetables.
3.  Whisk all the dressing ingredients together with 4 tablespoons of the reserved cooking sauce, and pour over the salad. Sprinkle with the herbs and the fried shallots.
