## Steps

1.  Melt the butter or heat the oil in a frying pan. Add the garlic and saute for 2-3 minutes, just to soften and take the edge off its astringency. Add the chilli powder along with the lime zest and juice. Season with plenty of salt, then whisk together. Remove from the heat and add the lobster meat. Turn over lightly so the lobster is well coated in the flavoured butter.
2.  Segment the oranges over a bowl to catch any juices, then squeeze the membranes and peel over the bowl to extract more juice. Arrange the segments with all the other salad ingredients, including the lobster, over a large platter drizzling over the buttery juices as well. Whisk together the dressing ingredients with some salt, then drop spoonfuls of this over the lobster. Serve immeaditely.
