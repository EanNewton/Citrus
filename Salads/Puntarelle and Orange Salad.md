## Steps

1.  Trim off the spears from 1 large heard of puntarelle, working towards the middle. You want mainly white stems and fronds here, so discard those that are dark green. Cut into thin slices on the diagonal and put into a large bowl of cold water. Leave to soak for a couple of hours. 
2.  Cut the peel and membranes from 2 large oranges and cut into slices, flicking out the pips as you go. Juice another orange and mix with 2 tbsp hazelnut or walnut oil, 1 tsp mustard, and 1 tbsp lemon juice. Whisk together and season with salt and pepper. Drain the puntarelle and arrange on a serving plate (it will have curled up attractively) with the orange slices, and drizzle over the dressing.
