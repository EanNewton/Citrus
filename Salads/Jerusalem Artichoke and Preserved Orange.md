## Steps

1.  Add the juice of 1/2 lemon to a bowl of ice-cold water. Peel about 8 medium artichokes then slice them in very thin rounds, dropping them into the acidulated water as you go. When you are ready to serve, drain them thoroughly and arrange over a plate. Julienne 1 tbsp preserved Seville orange zest and mix with 2 tsp of some of the liquor from the preserved orange, then thin with 2 tbsp fresh orange juice. Drizzle over the artichokes, followed by a drizzle of olive oil. This looks beautifully pure as is, but would also be good with a light sprinkling of micro coriander (cilantro).
